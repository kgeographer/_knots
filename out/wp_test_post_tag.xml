</div>
    <p>On this day in 1810 and not far from where these&#160;photos were taken, Sarah Margaret Fuller was born. In forty short years,&#160;the journalist-philosopher-linguist-futurist-feminist accomplished more writing by hand and traveling by carriage, train, and ship than a dozen jet-fueled, digitally equipped people combined today might. Although her name was among the handful of &quot;<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2007/07/the-most-famous.html">most admired women</a>&quot; at the end of the 1800s&#160;(astonishing given that&#160;she&#039;d already been dead for half a century), she remains relatively unknown today, except among the &quot;Fullerenes,&quot; those for whom Margaret has gotten under their skin. That turns out to be a lot of people, including...me.</p>
<p>Since 1973, the year I discovered Margaret&#039;s work, <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/05/the-fullerenes.html">I&#039;ve made an annual pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/05/margaret-fullers-199th-birthday-may-23-2009.html">Fuller Family plot</a> at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Margaret&#039;s father, Timothy Fuller, a lawyer who served&#160;in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and in the US Congress, and mother, Margarett Crane Fuller, along with their other children, are all buried there, as is their most famous relative, Bucky Fuller, and his wife, Anne Hewlett Fuller. Bucky&#039;s grandfather was Margaret&#039;s brother. Re: me, insofar as this is my blog, Bucky wrote the <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2011/01/buckys-foreword-to-the-networking-book.html">Foreword</a> to Jeff Stamps&#039; and my second book, <em>The Networking Book</em>. There, Bucky makes the link between the seemingly overwhelming challenges we face and their resolution lying largely in the work required to build networks among nations, people, and ideas.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mt_imported_image_1757840944-2.jpg"><img alt="Trimtab marker" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401bb0904d92c970d img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mt_imported_image_1757840943.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Trimtab marker" /></a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">A memorial stone, bearing a 25-line inscription, stands above the grave of Margaret and her husband, Marquis Giovanni Angelo Ossoli&#039;s, little son&#039;s body. All three of them drowned in a shipwreck in sight of land off the coast of Fire Island. Only little Nino&#039;s body was found; Margaret&#039;s and Giovanni&#039;s bodies were swept out to sea, along with a treasured trunkful of her European writings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d0883401bb0904d8fe970d-pi"><img alt="Margaret memorial" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401bb0904d8fe970d img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mt_imported_image_1757840944.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Margaret memorial" /></a></p>
<p>Why is Margaret so important, even today? <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2015/05/happy-205th-sarah-margaret-fuller.html">She did things that women simply didn&#039;t do in her day</a>--and that many still find it difficult to do. She supported her mother and siblings after her father died suddenly when she was 25. A contemporary of Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, she was the editor of The Dial, arguably&#160;the first literary/political journal in the US. She was the first woman in the US to have a byline on the front page of a newspaper (Horace Greeley&#039;s New York Tribune)--and she had plenty, more than 250 in 18 months. She was the first American woman to serve as a foreign correspondent for a&#160;US newspaper, covering, among other topics, the Roman Revolution (1848-1849). She traveled alone both domestically and in&#160;Europe. And, among other books including translations of Goethe, she wrote the treatise that would serve as the principal manifesto undergirding the Seneca Falls Convention&#160;of 1848: <em>Woman in the Nineteenth Century.</em></p>
<p>In that short book, Margaret did something that few&#160;(if any?) have managed to do: she laid out what it means to be fully human, declaring that no woman could be fully realized until man too was realized, a break with conventional Western thinking that polarizes opposites. Margaret integrated them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But in fact they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman... Nature provides exceptions to every rule.</em></p>
<p>No writer has inspired me more with their thinking or their example. Margaret Fuller has set me off on many paths over the years, including most recently lighting&#160;fire to a trio of novels (&quot;Woman in the 21st Century&quot;) where I seek to reprise Margaret&#039;s thinking&#160;for our current predicament.</p>
<p>And, no quote of hers touches down more deeply than this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Let every woman, who has once begun to think, examine herself.</em></p>
<p>I try, especially each year on the&#160;day of Margaret Fuller&#039;s birth.</p>

</p>
<p>A few hours ago, I received this email from my friend of forty years, David Goodman:</p><blockquote><p><em>My mother left this stage at 1:18 AM this morning and is now with my father and brother Andrew and others on the next level. I am sure she is having a fine time.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/us/18goodman.html?ref=obituaries"><strong>Complete obit in New York Times</strong></a>, Aug 18, 2007 </p>
<p>Readers of this blog may remember <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">my post</a> of June 21, where I included, with his permission, the extraordinary postcard that David gave me in May when I had dinner with Carolyn Drucker Goodman (his mother) at her apartment on New York's Upper West Side. At nearly 92, she remained extraordinarily dignified, surrounded by the memorabilia of an historic life and the good taste of a sophisticated intellectual who'd lived in the city and known fascinating people.<br /> </p>
<p>Carolyn Goodman, as in the mother of Andrew Goodman, as in Goodman-Schwerner-and-Chaney, the three young civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi in 1964, here with the other two mothers at Andy's funeral.<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/18/funeral.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" alt="Funeral" title="Funeral" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/funeral.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
</p>
<p>David's light touch in reporting his mother's death is emblematic of her spirit. She carried herself with rare dignity and grace along avenues where others would have been crawling on the pavement begging. I don't know how anyone survives their child's death, no less brutal murder by the Ku Klux Klan, but she did, while maintaining a complex and influential career as a psychologist (assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein Medical School among other honors-see the jump page for her entire resume and list of publications) and maintaining a lifelong dedication to the <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/andrewgoodmanfdn/">Andrew Goodman Foundation</a> that she and her husband started in 1966.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/196609_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" alt="196609_cg_photo" title="196609_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/196609_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
From the moment I met Carolyn in 1969, I wanted to be like her. It was just months after her husband had died suddenly of a stroke, barely five years after her son's murder. (&quot;Andy's death killed him,&quot; David once told me.) She was 54 and, at 22, I was overcome with admiration at the composure of this absolutely gorgeous woman, who'd lost her child and husband in such rapid sequence. I was struck also with her beautiful skin (milk baths were the secret, David said).</p>
<p>Many times since, when I've felt overwhelmed by the cards on my table, I've thought of Carolyn, her just continuing, never wallowing, just continuing, positively, without complaint or fury, just continuing.<br /><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/1998_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" alt="1998_cg_photo" title="1998_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/1998_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a><br />In 2002, I was honored to present her with the Champions of Freedom Award from <a href="http://freedomhouse.com">Freedom House</a>, here in Boston. She was nearly 88 at the time, still very beautiful, warm, and articulate about the choices she'd made in her life.
</p>
<p>So tonight I've lit a very special candle, given to me by Sylvia, my Antioch college roommate, about the time we both met David. Today is Sylvia's 60th birthday and she too was with me for our last dinner with Carolyn on May 18, 2007.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; New York, NY</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; LIFEâS WORK AND CURRICULUM VITAE</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has been working for causes of social justice for most of her life.&nbsp; During her undergraduate years at Cornell University, she and her husband-to-be were involved in organizing Farmer Cooperatives.&nbsp; In the late 1930s she became Womenâs Division Chair of the Join Antifascist Refugee Committee that supported Spanish Republicans who fled or were exiled by Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the early years of her marriage to Robert Goodman, a graduate of the Cornell School of Engineering, Carolyn Goodman began her graduate work in psychology.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman became Assistant Clinical Professor, Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Unit Chief of PACE Family Treatment Center a program of the Bronx Psychiatric Center.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Goodman designed the Parent Adult Child Education Program (PACE), in 1968 for emotionally disturbed mothers with high risk preschool children.&nbsp; PACE has been replicated in this country and abroad and in September, 1980 was presented with a GOLD Award for program excellence by the Board of Hospital and Community Psychiatry of the American Psychiatric Association.&nbsp; PACE was also the recipient of the Ruth Kirzon Group Humanitarian Award for Services to Handicapped Children.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Goodman administered the PACE program, provided direct clinical services to parents, children and teachers.&nbsp; She developed curriculum for PACE staff education and medical students, conducted seminars for local and national mental health agencies and supervised Fellows, residents, other clinicians and undergraduate students in the mental health field.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman has written and published a number of articles on the treatment and psycho-education of high risk families.&nbsp; See Attachment A for a detailed list of her Professional Training, Academic Honors, Professional Experience, Selected Publications and Presentations, and Awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman had three sons; Jonathan, Andrew and David born in 1941, 1943 and 1946, respectively.&nbsp; Andrew Goodman, the second of her sons, was murdered for his unflagging belief in equal justice for all.&nbsp; He was a volunteer in the Mississippi 1964 Summer Project, an important step in the Civil Rights Movement involving thousands of students, teachers, lawyers, doctors, and clergymen.&nbsp; Shortly after arriving in Mississippi, on June 21, 1964, he, along with James Chaney and Michael Schwerner, were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia, Mississippi.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deaths of these three young activists was a tragedy that illuminated the evils of a segregated community that shook the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn and Robert Goodman founded the Andrew Goodman Foundation in 1966 to help carry on the goals and dreams of Andrew Goodman.&nbsp; Sadly, Robert Goodman died suddenly in 1969.&nbsp; In 1989, 25 years after the death of her son Andrew, Carolyn Goodman called together the Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner families to form a coalition that would commemorate and perpetuate the legacy not only of the three young men but of the thousands of people, black and white, who had risked and lost their lives in the struggle for civil and human rights.&nbsp; The credibility of the Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Coalition captured the interest of young people and attracted the attention of the national media.&nbsp; A Freedom Caravan traveled from Philadelphia, Mississippi to New York City, where thousands of people heard speakers such as former Governor Mario Cuomo, artists such as Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Peter Paul and Mary, and Jessye Norman celebrate youth action.&nbsp; These artists and speakers reminded the crowd of the need to carry the torch lit by their counterparts 25 years earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the summer of 1994, Carolyn Goodman under the auspices of the Andrew Goodman Foundation sponsored an unprecedented project called Freedom Summer â94.&nbsp; Through this project, the Andrew Goodman Foundation provided training and technical assistance to youth organizers from all over the country.&nbsp; YouthAction, one of these groups, a national youth organization, formerly part of the Executive Committee of Freedom Summer â94, continues to train grassroots organizers who are growing in numbers and effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Inspired by the work being done by young people, and frustrated that social action by todayâs youth is ignored, Carolyn Goodman and the Andrew Goodman Foundation initiated its latest project, a documentary about youth activism in the 1990s entitled HIDDEN HEROES.&nbsp; This film tells the story of todayâs young activists, people who are working to improve the quality of life in their communities.&nbsp; Despite the mediaâs portrayal of todayâs young people as apathetic and violent, there are young organizers addressing issues of local concern, such as education, ecology, voter registration, anti-drug intervention, and racial tension.&nbsp; HIDDEN HEROES has been distributed to schools, libraries and other educational outlets to inform young people about essential work being done by their peers.&nbsp; The film is accompanied by a curriculum guide, prepared by students under the auspices of the Community Relations Department of Shoreham â Wading River High School of New York, and was developed by a highly experienced educator.&nbsp; &nbsp;It has helped teachers lead discussions that promote a different perspective from that of negative media messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has spoken at schools, colleges, churches, synagogues, museums, the United Nations and before various local, state and federal governmental bodies on all subjects relating to social activism for human dignity and civil rights.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just received this from <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/fiction-book-cl.html">Ron Currie Jr.</a>, whose father, Ron Sr., is being treated at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Today's the day they're raising money for The Jimmy Fund, which I learned about when a beautiful young man whom I love dearly was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three. Here's Ron's note:</p><blockquote><p>Today is the annual radio telethon to raise money for the Jimmy
Fund at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. This is a big event
here in New England, esp. among Red Sox fans, as the club has been
affiliated with the Jimmy Fund since 1948. My father is being treated
at Dana Farber, so I've seen firsthand the really incredible work they
do there. I know you hear that all the time but it's really true,
especially in their work with children and emphasis on family. So
consider skipping the mochaccino today and kicking that ten bucks over
to the Jimmy Fund instead.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web Worker Daily has <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/08/16/enhance-productivity-multiple-monitors/">a good post</a> on the value of using multiple monitors. With several applications open, I do find myself rooting through my desktop just as I do for a piece of paper on my desk (meaning same level of frustration). Where&#039;s the spreadsheet (better, which spreadsheet was it), why can&#039;t I click back into Word (idiotically left FIND open but can&#039;t see that because I&#039;m copying something off a web page), which tab do I need on the browser (oh, off the screen)...I could put an end to all this if I simply used both the monitors on my desk, leaving work fully open across the screens. Duh.</p>
<p>PS: First time I saw serious numbers of monitors in people&#039;s offices was at Apple&#039;s R&amp;D campus in Cupertino, California. Like six. Or eight. I never saw an office with only a single monitor. That was 1995. By now, they must have wraparound screens covering all walls.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For reasons as yet unrevealed (and certainly not because I subscribe to the fine <a href="http://www.interweaveknits.com/">Interweave Knits</a>), about six months ago, <a href="http://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a> showed up in my mail. And I don't mean my inbox. We have an old-fashioned mail slot cut into the wall by the front door of our old house. For the past six months or so, WIRED has been among the daily deluge of catalogs. When the August issue arrived, I got excited. &quot;How To: ... &quot; followed by a long list that included &quot;Rule the Blogosphere&quot; and &quot;Email like a Pro&quot; got me turning pages.</p>
<p>Well, I'm still looking for tips on how to rule the blogosphere. Great cover teaser, no article by that name. But -- and especially if -- you're a cube captain with action figures decorating your work space, there's lots here for you (e.g., never place Wonder Woman and Superman in, you know, suggestive positions).</p>
<p>There's a great 100-word (if that) squib on what to do if you're the only person dialing into a conference call: &quot;Announce yourself when it begins and remind people that you cannot see air quotes or scribbles on the whiteboard. Have an intern email you digital snaps. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. And mute your phone when you're not speaking, so no one hears SportsCenter in the background.&quot; OR, perhaps, ask your co-workers to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webinar">web conferencing</a>?</p>
<p>&quot;Email like a Pro&quot; is terrific if you're, how shall I say this, engaged in shady activities? The six pointers are aimed at keeping you out of court, or jail, I can't tell. The actual title of this one, &quot;Lawyer-Proof Your Email,&quot; requires no further clarification.</p>
<p>There is a good little list on how to use a wiki. Other than that, the tips on how to refill the watercooler and how to bully your coworkers into donating more leave me, well, wondering why WIRED has sought me out.</p>

In honor of these new children's arrival, I've sent this short piece from </em>The Persuasion, <em>Chapter 18</em>, to the new mothers <em>(photos </em><em>by Priscilla Harmel</em><em>, left of Benjamin Israel, right of Ava Lester)</em>:<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/27/ava2.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/ava2.jpg" title="Ava2" alt="Ava2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a></p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the world of the newborn, in my case, newborns, was familiar terrain to the billions of women whoâd come before, but the two six-pound bundles of body, mind, and spirit that I was shuffling from breast to bath to back were portals to a universe unknown, never even considered, with its own rivers and storms, its own unsolvable mysteries.
</p></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>With the births, time forgot the concept of moving forward. It went
horizontal. Where even a week earlier, the hours clicked me along from
my writing desk to the garden to the dinner table to the living room
for a meeting, now they sent me sideways, depositing me in the
after-birth where time advanced so peacefully that I could eavesdrop on
the long conversation between the cardinals nested in the juniper on
the northeast corner of the garage, follow the scrape of Toninâs pencil
across his big white sheet of butcher paper in his studio up the spiral
stairs, vibrate to the tingle of chimes in the mountain laurel on the
patio below, all background music for the babies as they suckled,
working milk from my breasts, building muscle in their chins and cheeks
for all their jawboning to come.</p>
<p>
I constructed sentences whose words Iâd always known but whose peculiar sequencing Iâd never before considered.</p>
<p>
What lives lay in front of mine? How many generations would our family endure into the future?</p>
<p>
Who would populate our babiesâ worlds? Who would become their jewels, their lifelong companions whose secrets they kept?</p>
<p>
What confusions of the heart, unintended slights, self-doubts, and
disappointments would chafe their routines, pull rugs from under their
precious feet?</p>
<p>
Were my babiesâ cries despairs at the plight of human existence or were
they little thespians practicing for their dramas to come?</p>
<p>
How would they solve the riddles born with their souls?</p>
<p>
What foods would the people who grew in me crave? Would they love beets?</p>
<p>
Had they, my little daughter and my little son, had they enough to eat? Would they always?</p>
<p>
Would Toninâs intuition and my logic short-circuit the genetic wires in their brains?</p>
<p>
Would Andy write? Would Zivvy build? Would she lead an organization; would he be a rock star?</p>
<p>
Or would they move to another planet entirely, another solar system, a
universe far beyond the second floor of this eighteenth-century house
where they were born? Where would I be then?</p>
<p>
Where was my edge limned and where did their selves begin?</p>
<p>
I explored their mental caves, twirling fragments of cognition gelling
in their small brains. I could see through their fleshy foreheads,
rippled with the tracks of the birth canal, into the arithmetic of
their minds, observing ideas dividing and multiplying, memories stored,
the two halves of Zivvyâs brain rushing toward each other at twice the
speed of Andyâs (my facts were never far away). I tried to perceive
from their insides, from their points of view, watching them opening
their eyes to acquire mental snapshots of their new world, and assuming
that, when they closed them, they assembled what theyâd captured into
panoramas of their dawning worldviews.</p>
<p>
And who was I on this journey?</p>
<p>
Iâd been piecing my own reality together for almost three decades, my
own world, and now my own included two more people Iâd never expected,
twin shocks whose arrival toppled my balance and sped me into new
territory.</p>
<p>
They were Toninâs babies before they were mine, he wanted them long
before I was entertaining thoughts of children, he needed them to be
who he wanted to be. Now I was the mother, not the child without one, I
was protector, provider, materfamilias, once and forever humanityâs
first face to these two of its progeny.</p>
<p>
These thinkings, these awes, these terrors unsettled and delighted me
as baby-time ticked by, every moment, the one after and the one before,
changing Zivvyâs diaper, wiping away Andyâs spit-up. I circled the
whole of Zivvyâs round back with my thumb, working the bubble of air up
her digestive track until she could expel it in a belch louder than she
was big, and then Andy cried out and my chemistry called back, rushing
oxytocin to unlatch the milk locks, trickling out through my nipple
even before he started sucking, on to his cheek as he turned his head
this way and that, searching for the spigot with its hindmilk, the
honey settling at the bottom.</p>
<p>
Twenty, thirty minutes, two hours passed this way, me trying to recall
how long weâd been lying there, which one Iâd last changed. When had I
most recently eaten? Had I eaten? Me, no longer simply me.</p>
<p>
Andrew. My fatherâs name, his genetic material, his head in the palm of
my hand, my little boyâs body stretched out along my arm, his face
wrinkled and splotchy, and, though the same weight as Zivvy, six
pounds, one ounce (I did know how to carry them to term, as I would
prove again astonishingly soon after this), rounder, an integer
shorter, he, a foot and a half, she plus an inch.</p>
<p>
My son with the magnificent feet. Iâd never been much of a photographer
but, as a gift to mark the pregnancy, Janos had put a 35-millimeter
Pentax in my hands. Over the course of the past months, Iâd practiced,
taking pictures of Treasure pounding down her sourdough loaves and
gathering up her squash blossoms, of the granite Buddha Tonin had set
by the mountain laurel. In early February only Buddhaâs crown peaked
above snow and we called him Snow Buddha; in April, he was Tulip Buddha
with pink ones at his feet. And of Tonin, many pictures, of Tonin
examining a bevel heâd just made in an edge, smoothing his palm across
a board heâd just sanded, standing at his drafting board jotting notes
on his big white sheets, cracking eggs into a bowl for our <em>omelettes
aux fines herbes</em>.</p>
<p>
I learned to set the light meter, adjust the shutter speed, snap, snap,
snap, thread the film across the sprockets, and wind the reel in an
instant. Now, I was focusing the 105-millimeter lens down on Andyâs
perfect feet, his long wrinkled toes crimped into the soles.</p>
<p>
Zivvy, born longer, was smooth. Where Andyâs feet captivated me,
Zivvyâs head did, delicate in its proportions, crown to forehead,
eyebrows to chin, nose to cheeks, precise. Her little symmetrical face.
Eyes even, equal, wide, intricately edged lips, pursed, small fist by
her cheek waiting to wave (or punch). She didnât sleep the way Andy
did, not that she fussed; she came out of me with her eyes open and
stayed awake a good deal of the time. When she did sleep, she woke
quickly, alert, ready to go, my daughter. My daughter.</p>
<p>No longer just a
daughter, now the mother of one.</p>
<p>
Of two.</p></blockquote>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glad to be contributing to the stats here in The Hub, where, apparently, there are <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/boston_bloggies.html">more bloggers</a> per block than anywhere else on earth, including Silly-con Valley, as per this post to the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/">Daily Business Update</a>. And happy to see our friend, <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/index.html">David Weinberger</a>, quoted, possibly the most quotable person I know:</p><blockquote><p> According to <a href="http://outside.in/Boston">OutsideIn.com</a>,
a website that tracks neighborhood blogging, Boston was the &quot;bloggiest
city&quot; in America for the two-month period of March and April.</p>
<p> Behind Boston were Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p> OutsideIn.com says it tracks blogging activity in about 60 urban
areas and nearly 3,500 neighborhoods, and it arrived at its rankings
through a &quot;blogging quotient&quot; that factors in a metropolitan area's
population with the number of blog posts about a specific location.</p>
<p> By that measure, Greater Boston had 89 posts per 100,000 residents,
edging out Greater Philadelphia, which had 88 posts, and Greater
Pittsburgh, which had 53 posts, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, perhaps, such well-wired metro areas as San Francisco
and Seattle were farther down the list, with roughly 40 posts per
100,000 residents, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Why was Greater Boston number one? Outsidein.com chief executive
Steven Berlin Johnson offered this theory: Blogs thrive where locals
are wired, well-educated, and obsessed with politics, a topic that
inspires bloggers to unleash their prose. Another popular blog topic
locally: healthcare...</p>
<p> Blogs are such a new phenomenon that methods for tracking blog
activity are still in their early stages, said David Weinberger, a
fellow at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p> And in seeking to pinpoint blogging hotbeds, he added, raw numbers
may not tell the whole story; also relevant are the quality of the
content and whether blog posts help build a community.</p>
<p>Still, Weinberger said, &quot;I'm proud to live in the bloggiest city in the universe.&quot;</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers of the Boston Globe are becoming used to seeing <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/whos-your-favor.html">Roland Merullo's</a> Monday column. At least this reader. I eagerly turned to the op-ed page today and there, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/08/13/counting_up_my_foreign_fox_pass/">again</a>, Roland holding forth in his humorous way, today about accents. When I first met Roland, I was impressed that he had not ironed out his heavy Boston accent. Writers with aspirations (and affectations) often replace ahhs with rs. Not Roland. He's from Reveeyuh (Revere) and I revere him for holding fast to his identity (another version of <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/holding-the-pos.html">holding the pose</a>).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/challenges-of-v.html">I sat in</a> on a <a href="http://www.netage.com/virtualteams/education.html">virtual team training</a> where there were people from at least four countries - maybe more, we didn't take a poll. One Spanish-speaking native apologized for his accent, said he was trying to improve it. Instantly - more accurately, without thinking - I said, &quot;Don't! Never give up your accent.&quot;</p>
<p>This one hits home for me. My father, Marvin Lipnack (originally Lipniak), spoke Yiddish first, learning English in first grade in a public school on New York's Lower East Side. For years he stuttered and when his 9th grade teacher made fun of him, he ran out of school and never returned, finally getting his high school diploma via GED when he was 29.</p>
<p>So, my friends, whatever your accent, wherever you're from, speak like the person you are. Be like <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/roland_merullo_.html">Roland.</a></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, a young friend with whom I've practiced yoga many times, told me she'd just done &quot;breakthrough yoga.&quot; I wondered what she meant specifically but understood from experience without her answering. A yoga session where you feel &quot;back,&quot; where you're limber, aligned, in balance, at peace with your body. How had she gotten there this time, I asked?</p>
<p>&quot;Holding the pose,&quot; she said. &quot;Things happen when you hold the pose.&quot; She went on to say that she'd been holding headstand and shoulder-stand for five minutes each, forward bend for ten, twenty minutes of Sun Salutation. If you've done any of these postures, you can appreciate what these lengths of time mean. If you've never done yoga, try this: Lean forward, trying to touch your finger tips to your toes. Now stay there for ten minutes. That's what forward bend is (also done seated and with infinite variations).</p>
<p>So the next time I did yoga, I got out a digital clock, moved it to various spots so that I could see it (just try looking at a clock in headstand), and held and held and held. Things do happen when you hold the pose. Awareness of tight muscles that soften, gripping that loosens, leaning more to one side than the other that rights itself. Things happen and suddenly you're considerably more straight, palpably more relaxed, stronger, more centered. This is why I love yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga postures -- asanas in the lexicon -- are challenging. Even &quot;corpse&quot; pose -- where all you do is lie in a relaxed state on the floor -- is a challenge when done properly. Same is true for most challenges. The longer you stay with them, the more you learn, the more resistance gives way.</p>
<p>I offer this to all who are trying things that seem impossible or just plain difficult. Hold the pose and things happen.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ellenmeister.com/">Ellen Meister</a> is a generous contributor to <a href="http://zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a>, where I met her. <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/10/meistercover_2.jpeg"><img width="300" border="0" alt="Meistercover_2" title="Meistercover_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/meistercover_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
Over the past few years, she's let other Zoetropers peer into her experience as a first-time author with a two-book deal.<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_oe_1_see_all/102-7551158-1680922?ie=UTF8&amp;relSet=0060824816">Secret Confessions of the Applewood PTA</a> </em>came out in hardcover in '06, as did the audio version narrated by Lisa Kudrow; paperback out now. Ellen's doing a virtual book tour, meaning interviews with her in lots of places.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My virtual teams alert brought me this article<span class="a4">&nbsp;</span>by Isabelle Chan from ZDNet<strong>, </strong>
<a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/business/0,39044229,62029492,00.htm"><strong>SAP takes AP shared services to new level</strong></a><span class="a4">. I left a comment with two questions:<br /><br />1. How does SAP reward its virtual teams?<br /><br />2. How do the co-located team</span>s stay tight with remote folks?</p>
<p>Inviting response from all you folks <strong>at</strong> SAP, who work <strong>with</strong> SAP, who worked <strong>at</strong> SAP, <strong>use</strong> SAP<strong>. </strong>There's a <br />huge body of knowledge about the virtual teams at this and other companies. And for those who have <strong>no clue</strong> re: SAP, what about you? How do you reward your virtual teams and keep &quot;far-flung&quot; members close?</p>
<p>Jump to my response to Isabelle Chan's article:</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Lots of good info here. Thanks.</p>
<p>
Questions:</p>
<p>
1. <em>One of the biggest challenges for a global company such as
SAP in maintaining a rewards framework is taking regional and cultural
differences into consideration, and accordingly managing expectations
of employees who work together in global virtual teams, or take
assignments or transfers in different regions.</em></p>
<p>
How does SAP reward its virtual teams?</p>
<p>
2. <em>According to SAP, a large part of the HR SSC team is
co-located in the same office with the other Asia-Pacific SSC groups.
This ensures tight integration between the teams to facilitate seamless
processes, for example, in the area of employee data and payroll
administration.</em></p>
<p>
What about the people not co-located? How do they remain &quot;tight?&quot;</p>
<p>
Thanks. Please post answers on my blog: www.netage.com/endlessknots </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FreePint's <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm">235th issue</a>, just out today, features <strong>My Favourite Tipples, </strong><a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#favourites">literally mine.</a> FreePint goes twice a month to roughly 100,000 &quot;information workers.&quot;</p>
<p>How does something like this come about, my list of favorite websites published in an online newsletter based in the UK? Hint to speakers: As people are coming into your next session, wander around, introduce yourself, ask people's names. Practicing my preaching, I did this at our <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com">Enterprise 2.0</a> workshop that Sandy Kemsley reported on in her post, <strong><a href="http://www.column2.com/2007/06/enterprise-20-reports-from-the-frontier/">Reports from the Frontier</a></strong><strong>.</strong> There I met <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#editorial">Monique Cuvelier</a>, editor of FreePint, who handed me her business card and suggested I might want to write something for the newsletter. After the conference, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/conferring-on-t.html">I fulfilled my pledge</a> to write to everyone who'd handed me a business card. Monique responded by asking me for this little piece.</p>
<p>Why not <a href="http://www.freepint.com/author/">send Monique</a> your &quot;tipples?&quot; Read on for mine.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

my work on networks and virtual teams--and as a writer, I'm always
looking around for creative and thought-provoking ideas -- here's where
I go on a regular basis to shake up my thinking. </p>
<ul class="plain"><li>For original thinking about the far edges of where the Web can take
us, bookmark Minding the Planet, where Nova Spivack holds forth:
&lt;<a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Michael Sampson of Christchurch, NZ, a tireless blogger and expert
on all things collaboration, is also known for his ability to take
verbatim notes at conferences and post them immediately:
&lt;<a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/">http://www.michaelsampson.net/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Writers (aren't we all writers now?), come hither! Francis Ford
Coppola's immensely generous gift to the writing community offers
review exchanges and excellent discussion forums - all completely
free: &lt;<a href="http://www.zoetrope.com/">http://www.zoetrope.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Running a Hospital, the blog of the CEO of a large American medical
centre, is informative about health care, as well as funny and
controversial, and even includes the occasional recipe:
&lt;<a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/">http://runningahospital.blogspot.com</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Travelling on your mind? Don't set foot in Oceania or a good part of
Asia without Turkeynose.com &lt;<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/">http://www.turkeynose.com</a>&gt;, where a
conscientious couple has posted detailed reports of their 6-month
journey, complete with ratings of every activity, form of
accommodation, and restaurant.</li></ul>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/09/jamesmirm.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/jamesmirm.jpg" title="Jamesmirm" alt="Jamesmirm" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
Huge cheers and high-fives to James Murrough, who's been named a National Institute of Mental Health Outstanding Resident for 2007. The notice to his colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital, where he is a PG-3 resident, reads: &quot;This is a highly competitive and prestigious resident award, and to be chosen reflects a tremendous effort and dedication to the science of psychiatry on Jamesâ part.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/09/jameslize.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/jameslize.jpg" title="Jameslize" alt="Jameslize" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>James, a graduate of Emory University and Tufts Medical School, also celebrates his 30th birthday today, a day we here at Endless Knots remember in great detail as he is our one and only nephew. Proud and thrilled for you, as always, James, shown here with his cousins at a significant family event a few years back.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <em><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/breast-cancer-3.html">Amanda Lipnack</a>, who walked the <a href="http://07.the3day.org/site/pp.asp?c=pmL6JnO8KzE&amp;b=2182495">Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 3-Day</a> last weekend, <a href="http://buzzy316.blogspot.com/">writes</a> about what she learned clocking 42 miles on foot in sweltering heat.</em></p><blockquote><p>...I also learned to honour my body and be proud of what it can do and not
be ashamed of what it can't do. I couldn't walk 60 miles this weekend
but I could walk 42 and that, quite frankly, is amazing. There was a
time in my life when walking up a flight of stairs was a challenge and
this weekend I walked up miles and miles of stairs. Up big hills and
down big hills -- over fields and roads and rivers and through the
pain, I kept walking. I have fought against my body for so much of life
but it felt very good to honour myself and be true.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/08/buzzy_3.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/buzzy_3.jpg" title="Buzzy_3" alt="Buzzy_3" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
</p>
<p>I wish such
an experience on the world around me. I wish that everyone can let the
noise around them disappear and focus on what is in front of them. I
wish that everyone can live life as it is meant to be lived, fully and
strongly. I walked behind people this weekend with signs on their back
that said &quot;I walk because I miss my mom&quot;. How can we let ourselves
forget that in a moment the things in front of us that we cherish can
be gone so we need to embrace and honour them in the moment.</p></blockquote>

Confused by all the new terms that get thrown around in meetings, in the paper, on TV, in emails? <a href="http://commoncraft.com">Common Craft</a>, a consulting company based in Seattle, Washington, has taken it upon itself to define terms in an amusing and easy-to-understand way. Its <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/video/social-bookmarking" target="_self">short online videos </a>-- &quot;Social Networking in Plain English,&quot; &quot;Wikis in Plan English,&quot; and &quot;RSS in Plain English&quot; -- are guaranteed to save you hours of anguish and embarrassment. Take a look and you&#039;ll thank me--and especially Common Craft--for this post.</p>
<p><em>Backstory-ish sort of thing: I found Common Craft because I subscribe (RSS feed) to <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/">KM Space</a>, which I discovered after its blogger, Doug Cornelius, wrote about <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/2007/06/90-people-10-technology.html">one of our sessions</a> at Enterprise 2.0. Thanks, Doug.</em></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's Boston Globe carries a short piece by business reporter Chris Reidy that is likely to cause some CIO arm hairs to stand at attention. <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a> confirms findings that we published with two business school professors in Harvard Business Review in May '04 (&quot;<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=R0405J">Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger</a>?&quot;).</p>
<p>In the study, designed by USC's Marshall School of Business Professor Ann Majchrzak and UNC'S Kenan-Flagler School of Business Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship Arvind Malhotra, we found that 50% of &quot;far-flung team&quot; members used Instant Messaging (IM) even when their companies prohibited it. The Yankee Group, whose research is reported today, says that only one-third of the companies they surveyed offer IM. But that doesn't deter employees who regularly find the best tools for their work, regardless of corporate IT policies.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: CIOs, Listen Up! Pay attention to the natural resources that your employees gravitate toward. Everyone wants work to be easier and so those with the energy will seek out those tools that serve them best.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>From Boston.com (under 500 words so OK to quote in its entirety):</p><blockquote><h2>Monday, August&nbsp; 6, 2007</h2>
<h3><a target="new" title="Employees bypassing IT departments" href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a></h3></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p> The widespread adoption of consumer technologies in the workplace,
such as outside instant messaging services, poses a potential threat to
corporate information-technology departments, according to a new report.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The report, titled &quot;Zen and the Art of Rogue Employee Management,&quot; is from the <a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/">Yankee Group</a>, a Boston-based market research group focused on global connectivity.</p>
<p> According to the report, nearly 50 percent of employees feel more
empowered than IT to control their personal IT environment, a
development that could lead to a potentially &quot;hazardous mix of secured
and unsecured applications in the enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p> Only about a third of companies offer instant-messaging, and when a
company doesn't, many employees will resort to using consumer IM
products from the likes of AOL or Yahoo to communicate sensitive
company information to colleagues and customers; these consumer
products lack the &quot;robust security&quot; measures that are a key feature of
workplace IM offerings, noted Joshua Holbrook, manager of the Yankee
Group Enterprise Research program. </p>
<p> To address this challenge, the Yankee Group suggests that corporate
IT departments adopt a &quot;Zen-like approach&quot; that doesn't seek to dictate
policy and enforce standards but rather looks to set guidelines and
steer employees in the right direction.</p>
<p>
(By Chris Reidy, Globe staff)</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/04/comes_the_peace.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/comes_the_peace.jpg" title="Comes_the_peace" alt="Comes_the_peace" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>Endless Knots author (there's always another) Daja Wangchuk Meston will speak about his memoir, <em>Comes the Peace: My Journey to Forgiveness </em>(Free Press, 2007), on Tues, August 7, 2007, at 7:30 PM at Newton Public Library, Newton, Massachusetts. <a href="http://www.ci.newton.ma.us/library/Programs/calendar.htm#peace">From the Library website</a>:</p><blockquote><div align="justify">
In 1999 Meston made international headlines when he attempted suicide
to escape Chinese imprisonment. Arrested while researching a potential
World Bank project sanctioning Chinese occupation of Tibetan land,
Mestonâs act spurred a worldwide out-pouring of support and led to his
release. <br /><br />
This is a powerful story of one manâs spiritual odyssey from a child
monk to a political symbol of freedom. Abandoned at the age of three by
hippie American parents, and sent to become a Buddhist monk in Nepal at
the age of six, Meston shed his robes and returned to the U.S. as a
teenager to reconcile his past and carve out a new future. While
attending Brandeis University, he married a woman whose family were
Tibetan refugees and began interpreting for journalists and
congressmen, traveling to the area on behalf of human-rights issues.
This gripping and eloquent memoir chronicles his unorthodox path,
offering a universal message of forgiveness along with a glimpse into
the inner workings of Tibetan Buddhism.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </div></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meston has been featured in <em>People</em> magazine and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p></blockquote><p>What makes Daja Meston an Endless Knots author? Your host here (and her hubby) joyfully gave a book party (recorded <a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2007/03/comes-peace.html#links">here)</a> honoring the book's publication. He and his wife, Phuni, are friends of many years. If you're in the Newton area, be sure to visit <a href="http://cometokarma.com/">Karma,</a> their shop of fine imported crafts. </p><blockquote></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/biztools/article.php/684871">Death by Powerpoint.</a> I can't verify that <a href="http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/biztools/article.php/684871">Angela R. Garber</a> coined the term but her 2001 article certainly was an early one.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://donmcmillan.com/">Don McMillan</a> does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpjrHzgSRM">stand-up on Powerpoint</a>, posted to YouTube.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/04/0399.jpg"><img width="300" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/0399.jpg" title="0399" alt="0399" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
In the past week, an old friend and a business acquaintance both wrote mentioning the impending marriages of their children. The former will officiate at his son's ceremony, which reminded me of a passage from </em>The Persuasion<em>, my novel featuring <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/the-most-famous.html">Margaret Fuller</a>. On a warm and beautiful summer day much like the one when the two characters, Mariana and Tonin, marry, I offer this short excerpt:<br /></em></p>

<!--more-->
<p><em>From </em>The Persuasion, <em>Chapter Nine:</em></p><blockquote><p>On July 19, a Wednesday, at four in the afternoon, Tonin and I were standing in the sunny field of wild lavender in front of T-villeâs dome. Deep in Pale Brook Park, him in a purple Nehru shirt and black pants, me in my purple Biafra Rising dress, facing Red Bird, in turquoise pajamas sheâd bought in Chinatown.</p>
<p>Bird read us hexagrams from the <em>I Ching,</em> âThe Creativeâ and âThe Receptive;&quot; we countered with words Tonin and I had written, almost all in French, which no one but us really understood, pledging fealty, constancy, honesty, and, above all, love âuntil,â as we recited together, âthe Universe itself swirled out of existence.â His hands shook as he slipped the wedding ring on my finger, a simple platinum band, the counterpart to the slightly wider one that I glided onto his. On the inside of each was inscribed â<em>M&amp;T â 19 Juillet 1973 - pour toute l'Ã©ternitÃ©</em>,â which the jeweler, whom weâd rushed to do the job, called âan ungodly number of characters for such small rings.â (He stopped complaining when Tonin pulled out his checkbook and signed over an additional hundred.)</p>
<p>âYou may now kiss the groom,â Red Bird said, which I did, and then we cupped each otherâs temples, drew our palms across the other's shoulders and down the arms, interlinking our fingers and twisting our wrists together, wrapping ourselves tight and kissing again for a very long time.</p>
<p>We cried and laughed as Toninâs grandfather snapped pictures with his Hasselblad (âDonât squint so much, Tonie,â he said), his grandmother swatted at mosquitoes with her straw hat, Janos and Erika kissed passionately, and my aunt sobbed uncontrollably for her sisterâs absence. Through the glint of tears, I thought I saw both my missing parents beaming back at us from the clearing beyond the blueberry bushes at the fieldâs edge â and next to them that same woman whoâd applauded us at the Brattleboro juice bar.</p>
<p>At that moment, the veil between them and us was porous; I didnât know whether they were really there or notâand I didnât care. Tonin and I were crossing into a new dimension together, and, as much as we claimed to discount the institution of marriage, we were ecstatic to become husband and wife.</p>
<p>My uncle Irving, a very sweet man who bore such a resemblance to the comedian Danny Kaye that people stopped him on the street and asked for his autograph, had brought along a record player and some L.P.s, which he set up in the dining cabin for the reception, such as it was. After stuffing ourselves like turkeys on Red Birdâs delectable feast, we danced past midnight to The Supremes, the Beatles, and my parentsâ favorite song, âThe Sunny Side of the Street.â Even though I had been so little then, I still could remember them doing the Charleston to this tune with huge crazy smiles on their faces in the living room of our apartment in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Tonin and I danced and danced past the time everyone else had gone to bed, finally slumping onto the glider on the porch of the dining hall, falling asleep half-sitting up with our arms around each other. We woke when the sun started its climb, grabbed our sleeping bags, and hiked back up to the geodesic dome that Tonin had been building for so long. We could smell the lavender before we could see the field. We went into the dome, spread our sleeping bags on the floor, lit a candle, and made love.</p>
<p>âMrs. Me,â Tonin said when we were done.</p>
<p>âMr. Me,â I replied.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a few minutes, I leave to drive my niece, Amanda Lipnack, to the start of the <a href="http://www.the3day.org/">Breast Cancer 3-Day</a>, a 60-mile walk through eastern Massachusetts, to raise money for research and awareness about breast cancer. The walk takes place on different weekends in different locations around the country, beginning with this one here in New England. You can join me in making a donation <a href="https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=202304&amp;supId=162100873">here.</a> Principal beneficiary of the walk: &quot;Eighty-five percent of the net proceeds from the Breast Cancer 3-Day
benefits Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the worldâs largest and most
progressive grassroots network fighting to end breast cancer.&quot; I'm very proud of Amanda - and hoping she won't be too hot as it's sweltering, even at 5 am.</p>
<p><em>After dropping Amanda off: There were hundreds and hundreds of cars, all politely following instructions, leaving off thousands of walkers. As I drove away, I thought of the women I know who've had breast cancer--three very close to me who died (my grandmother, Rae, my aunt, Frances, and my high-school roommate Robin) and my friends who were treated and doing fine (PH, JB, and MDS)--and then I thought of the thousands of women (and some men) whose families and friends were walking for them. These walks and rides and swims are powerful networks of support, love, and concern--and very good engines for raising funds for research. I hope everyone reading makes a donation now, while it's fresh in your mind.</em></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I had the chance to sit face-to-face with fifty people who work, for the most part, virtually. Their purpose in coming together was to learn some adaptive behaviors when at least one and, in some cases, entire factions of their colleagues are continents apart.</p>
<p>About an hour into the day's session, the leader asked the group to list their challenges in working virtually. Suddenly, a quiet room virtually (!) erupted:</p>
<ul><li>We don't really know one another; it's hard to build true personal relationships</li>
<li>We're unaware of people's real skills</li>
<li>We struggle to understand people with different accents</li>
<li>Our &quot;real-time window&quot; is very small--when we're working, they're sleeping</li>
<li>I feel isolated because I'm the only one on my team who works in a different location</li>
<li>We mean different things when we use technical terms</li>
<li>It's hard to get first-hand information</li></ul>
<p>The list, twice as long as what I'm posting here, points to the central challenge of working virtually: It's not what we see on the screen but what reflects back to us in the mirror. In our view, the key to making virtual teams work is our own ability to connect and communicate maturely, perhaps the biggest challenge of all.</p>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Jessica on the challenges of working virtually. i was actually in the room as the facilatator of a workshop on the best practices of working virtually. I have learned to deploy the best practices of virtual working ( thanks to Jessica and Jeff-NetAge Inc)
Although the challenges are difficult they can be overcome. There are many best practices which shape new behaviors to overcome the difficulties. Throw in some collaborative technologies and you have a winning approach. My experience has shown me that teams that use the approach can increase their virtual working capabilities by as much as 34%.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The challenges for making remote teams work together are enormous, but the benefits are immense (when it works). And Iâm not talking about the cost differential between countries, but giving (moral) credit to the best contributors â the âenlighteningâ feeling they were part of a bigger thingâ¦
When shaping up such a work model, best practices are great, as a final result, but how you get there?
My suggestions are:
1.  to first research the profile of your team, meet each and everyone face to face in his/her original setting and get a feel about their chemistry (within their local setting) â find out what makes them âtickâ,
2.  identity leaders and support group at the ground (functional) level â they will be your core group â the ârunnersâ between functions,
3.  create strong relationship with the local management â you canât enforce the projectâs rules without them,
4.  make a presentation to the local groups about expectations and send them positive signals about their contribution and how that would fit in the âproductâ,
5.  make a final presentation to the whole group where you talk about the components, functional groups, project management â the big picture,
6.  get definite buy ins at #4 and #5 and do it fast!
Now you have the framework where the best practices (and collaborative technologies) would workâ¦]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Cristian, right on with all of your points with this modification to #1. In many situations, it's not practical and/or possible to meet everyone face-to-face (F2F). For example, we've been working with a client that has extensive operations in India, literally hundreds of people working in multiple teams. For the leaders of those groups to meet everyone F2F, never mind everyone in the teams meeting F2F, would be difficult. In "Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger?", Harvard Business Review, May 2004, a study we did with two business school professors, Ann Majchrzak and Arvind Malhotra, we found that F2F contact was not a critical determinant of virtual team success. Most of our teams never met F2F yet had quite astonishing results.
That said, I'd always prefer F2F to online communication...but that's just me.]]></wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jessica,
We are reading a chapter from "Virtual Teams" at Quinnipiac University's introduction to interactive communications course.  I really enjoyed the chapter that we read.  Although the trust issue was something I thought was worth discussing, virtual teams are something I don't mind getting used t0 :-)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, we've received scores of requests from graduate students around the world seeking help with their research on virtual teams, networks, and collaboration. In the past two years, there has been a sharp upturn in those requests. Yesterday, we received this note from Ernest Cutuk:</p><blockquote><p>I am a master's student at the Graduate School of Economics &amp; Business University of Zagreb, Croatia conducting research on virtual teams. The thesis' title is âManaging virtual teams in the project environment&quot;. </p>
<p>Should you have five minutes time, I would like to ask you to answer on questions listed in the questionnaire that you will find in the attachment and send it back to me via e-mail address: ernest.cutuk@zg.htnet.hr&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to receive the final result of the questionnaire, please be so kind to send me your e-mail...</p></blockquote><p>If you'd like to participate in Ernest's research (we are), please read on to the jump page here to fill out his questionnaire. And...I encourage other students to send their surveys as well. If they're legit, we'll post them and we hope that you all will publish your findings back here too. Good luck, Ernest!</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ron Currie, Jr's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Dead-Jr-Ron-Currie/dp/0670038679">God is Dead</a> </em>is #10 on the <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/blog/2007/07/hardcover_ficti_30.html">Boston, Mass, bestseller list</a>, proving, once again, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/endless-knots-i.html">the books and writers</a> profiled on Endless Knots are...bestsellers! What this also means, <a href="http://www.roncurriejr.com">Mr. Currie</a>, is that you're next up for the famous Endless Knots interviews. And, today, the British newspaper, The Guardian, publishes a long and thoughtful <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,2136307,00.html">review</a> of the book, comparing Ron to Raymond Carver, whom he regularly cites as one of his greatest influences, and, of course, Kurt Vonnegut (who also went by Jr for much of his early career). Having had the very good fortune of hosting the first book party for Ron's book, I am especially thrilled to see these great new developments. Now, readers, go buy the book and post back what you think. I'm waiting.<br /> </p>

Tomorrow night, the Green Monster at Boston's sacred Fenway Park welcomes The Police, perhaps the only rock band in history to sing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_(album)">Arthur Koestler's thinking</a> (&quot;Synchronicity,&quot; their 1983 album). Koestler is how I learned about The Police, actually. In 1978, Jeff Stamps was just finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holonomy-Systems-Jeffrey-S-Stamps/dp/0914105175"><em>Holonomy,</em></a> his dissertation, when Koestler, the great systems theorist, invited him to his cottage in the English countryside. Jeff had drawn heavily on Koestler's work on <a href="http://www.netage.com/networks/model/network/holonarchy.html">holons</a>, work that still undergirds much of our work. From then on, I noticed anything connected with Koestler...thus Sting.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1995. Apple Computer (not Records) was taking its first steps toward creating a &quot;global&quot; software development organization. Doesn't sound like much today but it was one of the early experiments (during a non-Steve Jobs period) to create a seamless software organization across many countries and cultures. Steve Teicher, an Apple VP at the time, hired us to help.</p>
<p>Our book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471147400/sr=1-8/qid=1185536608/ref=olp_product_details/102-7551158-1680922?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1185536608&amp;sr=1-8&amp;seller="><em>The Age of the Network</em></a>, had just come out. Books take a long time to write, which means countless hours listening to your own voice in your head. Thus, every writer has a method to prevent madness. For this book, Jeff and I used the same one: &quot;Fields of Gold,&quot; Sting's luscious linger on nature and love. Over and over. Literally thousands of times. So many times that when we wrote the Acknowledgments, he got one: &quot;Sting provided <em>Fields of Gold</em>, the background music<em>.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Apple group had convened in Tokyo, where The Park Hyatt had just opened, thus deals available. So did we find ourselves in a hotel with Al Gore, then US vice president, Bill Gates, a dozen six-foot-tall, one-hundred-pound models, and ...</p>
<p>Steve Teicher, Pam Martin (project manager for the global group), Jeff and I were at breakfast in the hotel's main dining room (not the place where you have to make reservations). Just the plain old dining room. When all of a sudden, Pam grabbed my arm and screeched in a high whisper, &quot;JESSICA! THAT'S STING OVER THERE!&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed. Sting, two tables over, with three friends, the night after he'd performed in Tokyo.</p>
<p>And I had our book.</p>
<p>So I got up, thinking about how the sleeves of my sweater were too long, and how intrusive it was for me to be doing this, and how completely absurd I felt, when I found myself standing next to Sting, apologizing for intruding, explaining the background music, whereupon he took the book. &quot;So I'm responsible for this,&quot; he said, and read the subtitle: &quot;'Organizing Principles for the 21st Century.' I need this book. I was very disorganized in the 20th Century.&quot;</p>
<p>And thus began my career as Sting's tour manager, a brief but rewarding period.</p>
<p>(Did anyone believe that?) No, I turned it into fiction, or maybe, more accurately, faction, a story called &quot;Sting and I.&quot;</p>
