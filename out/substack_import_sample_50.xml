  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need a new primary care physician (mine is leaving to go into &quot;international medicine&quot;). Leopard-spotted roses are more plentiful than PCPs, apparently. My search has been abetted by suggestions from friends who &quot;love&quot; their doctors (needless to say, all those physicians&#039; practices are closed), the high and mighty who control hospital systems and kindly have their assistants searching on my behalf, and friends who are MDs, who have excellent opinions about what I should do (thanks, K, for the terrific advice last night).</p><p>In the course of this search, I&#039;ve read a lot of doctors&#039; bios, which means I&#039;ve been to a lot of medical provider websites. More than once I&#039;ve run into the description of doctors with <a href="http://www2.massgeneral.org/mghwest/mghw_ourservices_adultpc.htm">&quot;preventative&quot; medicine</a> as their specialty.</p><p>No. It&#039;s <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preventative">preventive</a>. My mother, the English teacher, drilled this into me. But don&#039;t take it from me. Here&#039;s what Webster&#039;s says:</p><div class="sep_top shd_hdr" style="margin-left: 40px">
<div class="lunatext">
<p><strong>Preventative</strong></p>Pre*vent&quot;a*tive\, n. That which prevents;  -- incorrectly used instead of preventive.<br /><br />

  <title>Socially responsible healthcare consuming?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boston Globe is looking into the dirty little secrets of the healthcare world around here in a two-part Spotlight series (&quot;<em><em>Spotlight Team members [are] Scott Allen, Marcella Bombardieri, Michael
Rezendes, and editor Thomas Farragher, as well as Liz Kowalczyk and
Jeffrey Krasner of the Globe staff. It was written by Allen and
Bombardieri.&quot;]</em></em></p><p><em><em></em></em>The first article, which ran a couple of days ago, &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/a_healthcare_system_badly_out_of_balance/">A healthcare system badly out of balance</a>,&quot; discloses that the same tests and procedures receive wildly different reimbursements from insurers depending on where they&#039;re done. Look and ye shall see:</p><div style="text-align: center"><br /><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010536038038970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="MRI chart" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010536038038970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842602.jpg" /></a>
<br /></div><p><br />So why am I posting this? Because I need an MRI. This is not an unusual situation for me - as previously revealed, I have <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/ms/">MS</a> and MRIs are one principal way of tracking whether more plaque is building up in the brain, which is, like plaque on your teeth, not a good thing. My wonderful, beloved, attentive (and suffering from the flu) neurologist promptly returned my call yesterday, listened to my symptoms, and said the expected, that I should subject myself to the impossible hammerjack procedure once again (painless yet intensely annoying, for those of you who haven&#039;t had it - and not for the claustrophobic, i.e. take the Valium, if they offer it).</p><p>Then I remembered the chart, where I had instantly gone to the column with the MRIs earlier this week. If I go to his hospital, it will cost my health insurer roughly twice what it would if I go to the hospital just across town. Both are excellent hospitals - though this series has lifted up another blind, i.e. in many regards, the less expensive hospitals have superior results. I don&#039;t know about MS or MRI comparisons so I won&#039;t comment. What I do now is that I have a truly superior relationship with my neurologist and that I&#039;ve been astonishingly healthy under his care, i.e. why tamper with something that works?</p><p>But...here&#039;s where the socially responsible reflex comes in. Can I in good conscience cost our overburdened healthcare system another half a thou to get the results of a pretty standard procedure? Now that the info is out there, it&#039;s really hard to know how to proceed. What would you do?</p>

And by the time you educate them to think that way, they&#x27;ll recognize there are more effective ways to reduce health care costs and they&#x27;ll press for those.<br/>In fact, you can probably do more to impact the health care system in your professional capacity than as a consumer.<br/>Although, it would benefit us all if everyone was a better health care consumer.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Lilly <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— December 05, 2008 at 08:18 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">It is clearly a question of market pricing and asymmetric pricing that is changing with the publication of costs.  Once they become known, the hospitals can not exploit the ignorance of the patients.<br/>Other elements come into the decision-for instance, your hospital may offer immediate scan at the time it suits you while the other may be less flexible.  If it does not matter to you, go for the cheaper option, especially if your specialist has no problem with the source of data. In fact, you would be expanding his professional network by doing so  and lying ground for other patients to take the same option in the future.<br/>In short, my inclination would be to go to cheaper hospital, if nothing else, to show the one you normally use that people like you take action on new information.<br/>Glad to hear that treatment is working.  Look after yourself!<br/>Best from deep night in Virginia Water, UK<br/>Lilly</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Jessica Lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— December 05, 2008 at 09:47 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Thanks, Lilly. Take a look at the Globe article that prompted this post, referenced there. The hospitals don&#x27;t exactly set the prices; they have some position in the market that enables them to negotiate with the insurers. And one group dominates in the Boston market. In truth, all the hospitals in Boston are pretty darn good but the sweet deal that one group gets is irritating to the other good ones and rightfully so. We need your complexity thinking on solving this problem!</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I would get the care, specifically doctor and hospital/facility, that I think is in going to provide me the best health outcome.  To me that's the only consideration in my decision.
How much an insurance company is going to reimburse my health care providers is irrelevant.</wp:comment_content>

And by the time you educate them to think that way, they'll recognize there are more effective ways to reduce health care costs and they'll press for those.
In fact, you can probably do more to impact the health care system in your professional capacity than as a consumer.
Although, it would benefit us all if everyone was a better health care consumer.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>It is clearly a question of market pricing and asymmetric pricing that is changing with the publication of costs.  Once they become known, the hospitals can not exploit the ignorance of the patients.
Other elements come into the decision-for instance, your hospital may offer immediate scan at the time it suits you while the other may be less flexible.  If it does not matter to you, go for the cheaper option, especially if your specialist has no problem with the source of data. In fact, you would be expanding his professional network by doing so  and lying ground for other patients to take the same option in the future.
In short, my inclination would be to go to cheaper hospital, if nothing else, to show the one you normally use that people like you take action on new information.
Glad to hear that treatment is working.  Look after yourself!

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks, Lilly. Take a look at the Globe article that prompted this post, referenced there. The hospitals don't exactly set the prices; they have some position in the market that enables them to negotiate with the insurers. And one group dominates in the Boston market. In truth, all the hospitals in Boston are pretty darn good but the sweet deal that one group gets is irritating to the other good ones and rightfully so. We need your complexity thinking on solving this problem!</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Sun's good results from telecommuting</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ted Samson has an instructive and fact-filled report in InfoWorld on Sun's success in sending workers home, &quot;<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/sustainableit/archives/2008/06/telecommuting_s.html">Sun, employees find big savings from Open Work telecommuting program</a>.&quot; This is the emblem of the article I want to just steal and post here but alas, you must click. You MUST, it's that worth reading if you're in the ranks of those who make such decisions or in the ranks of those who'd like to see such decisions made. Thanks to <a href="http://stellacommute.blogspot.com/2008/06/i-havent-been-harping-on-eco-grooviness.html">Stella</a> for seeing this one first:</p><blockquote><p>Sun found that its U.S. employees worked at home an average of 2.1
days per week in 2007. In doing so, they saved an average of $870 per
year in gasoline (back when it was just $3.26 a gallon) and around
$1,770 dollars in wear and tear on their car (by driving 3,700 fewer
commute miles). They were also spared -- get this -- 104 hours of
commute time, which translates to around two and half weeks. This is
based on the finding that Sun U.S. employees have an average commute of
40 miles round-trip per day.</p>
<p>Presumably those savings make up for the fact that employees do need
to pay a negligible amount -- less than $20 per year, according to Sun
-- for the energy required to work from home, including heat.</p>
<p>Sun also found that employees used less energy at home than they do
at the office. &quot;Office equipment energy consumption rate at a Sun
office was two times that of home office equipment energy consumption,
from approximately 64 watts per hour at home to 130 watts per hour at a
Sun office.&quot; Contributing to the difference: Office employees tend to
use workstations and monitors while more home employees use laptops as
well as Sun Ray <strong><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/sustainableit/archives/2007/05/thinking_green.html">thin clients</a></strong>, both of which require less power than traditional desktop PC/monitor combos.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm speaking at &quot;KM 2.0 – Real or Hype?&quot; - the upcoming Boston KM Forum Symposium on Leveraging Knowledge at Bentley College.</p>
<p>Here's the abstract of my talk, &quot;Moving Beyond 2.0 Resistance:&quot;</p>
<p><em>Twenty years ago, an aspiring social network analyst asked us for the
names of everyone in our database. He had a program that could link
them up, he said, help them find one another, spark new connections.
How intrusive, I thought. Who’d want that? Years later, he would go on
to design one of the major social networking sites. I resisted and
resisted – and then something happened: someone I trusted explained
blogging to me, someone else invited me onto Facebook…and the rest is
what brings me to Boston KM Forum. This talk will be about resistance
to Web 2.0, even among people like myself who’ve been online forever,
and what happens when that resistance gives way to powerful experiences.</em></p>
<p>And here's the rundown of the other speakers and their topics:</p>
<p>* Mark Frydenberg, a Senior Lecturer at Bentley:&nbsp; Web 2.0 Tools for Knowledge Management</p>
<p>* Ray Sims, formerly Director of KM at Novell:&nbsp; KM and Web 2.0 – A User’s Perspective</p>
<p>* Dan Keldsen, Director of Market Intelligence at AIIM:&nbsp; Enterprise 2.0 = KM 2.0?</p>
<p>* Jeff Cram, Managing Director, and David Aponovich, Content Management Specialist, ISITE Design:&nbsp; Case Study:&nbsp; The Siemens BeFirst Portal</p>
<p>* Larry Chait, Chait and Associates:&nbsp; Wrap-up:&nbsp; KM 2.0 - Why We Should Care<br /></p>
<p>8:15-4:00 on Wednesday, April 9, 2008, Bentley College in Waltham, MA.&nbsp; The fee, including light breakfast and full lunch, is $50. </p>
<p>For more information and to register, go to the <a href="http://kmforum.org/blog/?p=47">Boston KM Forum site</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there…</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks, Amy. I'm considering trying to reconstruct my talk as I didn't make notes in advance. It's really gotten me thinking about why people and organizations resist change and what kinds of emotional alliances we can make that will help others bear the transition to the brave new world. Great to meet you!</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Hallelujah!  It has been driving me crazy, trying to reconstruct the trail of how I was led to your blog (because I was sure it wasn't directly via the KM Forum, I'm not that much of a space cadet).  It's BostonNow.  I am a committed T rider and read it most days and this blog is also posted there!</wp:comment_content>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, compatriots, in the interest of <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/10/transparency-an.html">ongoing transparency</a> vis-a-vis the economic mess, we're tracking the contracts as they're let by the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/">Office of Financial Stability</a>. You can track them too by signing up for alerts <a href="http://service.govdelivery.com/service/subscribe.html?code=USTREAS_145">here</a>. Using <a href="http://www.netage.com/economics/publish/USTreasury.html">OrgScope</a>, we're adding each new award and hire to the map. Click <a href="http://www.netage.com/economics/publish/USTreasury.html">this link</a>, wait a few seconds for the dynamic map to load, then click on down through the Office of Domestic Finance (it's over to the right) and then to the Office of Financial Stability and then you'll see the contract awards in purple boxes under the sub-departments awarding them. Roll over the purple box and you can see its value; double click and link right to the actual contract. The map below shows what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Here are the first three contracts as listed on Treasury's site.</p>
<p>According to the Treasury Department's October 13 <a href="http://service.govdelivery.com/service/subscribe.html?code=USTREAS_145">press release</a>, it hired <a href="http://ennisknupp.com">EnnisKnupp</a> as the first investment adviser. Contract total, which you can find <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/contract.pdf">here</a> is for $2.495 million.</p>
<p>On Oct 14, <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1211.htm">Treasury announced</a> its award to <a href="http://www.bnymellon.com/">Bank of New York Mellon</a> for a <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1211.htm">contract</a>&nbsp; &quot;to serve as its custodian for the
implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program authorized under
the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act...to help the
Department with custodial, accounting, auction management and other
infrastructure services needed to administer the complex portfolio of
troubled assets the Department will purchase.&quot; This is a three-year contract and the section containing compensation information is blacked out.</p>
<p>On Oct 16, <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1217.htm">Treasury announced its legal adviser</a>, <a href="http://www.stblaw.com/">Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett</a>, its contract <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/lawfirmcontract.pdf">here.</a> Total contract award for six months beginning Oct 10, 2008 = $300,000.</p><br />

I'm talking about books here.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/06/apologies-forth.html">Xujun Eberlein</a>'s first story collection, <a href="http://www.xujuneberlein.com/purchase.htm">Apologies Forthcoming</a>, had its debut on Saturday in her lovely garden at her home near where we live. Thus, we made a point of stopping by to enjoy the moment, commune with her friends, and taste some delicious food.</p>
<p>Here, Xujun with one of my very closest of friends, none other than the hubby, Jeff Stamps, appropriately attired in the T-shirt that matches his vehicle.</p>
<p>May this book party, X, be your first of many. And, to my readers: I've read the collection and recommend it without reservation. Original and compelling.</p>

  <title>Harvest Soup inspired by Daniel Bruce</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And now, by popular request, this recipe.</p>
<p>First came in contact with the basis for this soup when daughter Miranda (<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/recipes/recipes.html">her fine recipes</a>) took a semester away from college to earn her <a href="http://www.bu.edu/foodandwine/culinary/">certificate in culinary arts at Boston University</a>, highly recommended 14-week program. Each week, the public was invited to lectures with famous chefs (yes, I sat a few feet from Jacques Pepin, among others) as they cooked. A few times we were invited to actually cook with them. My big catch? <a href="http://www.bostonchefs.com/clients/Meritage/chef_page/">Daniel Bruce</a>, chef extraordinaire at the Boston Harbor Hotel, leading to my first and last time cooking fois gras.&nbsp; Bruce is the generator of the original recipe for the soup below that I’ve altered a bit. Thanks, Daniel, for the now heavily-stained printout of your menu/recipe list, “Autumn in New England: A Festive Dinner with Daniel Bruce, Wednesday, October 15, 1997.”</p>
<p>Harvest Soup (serves 12)</p>
<p>Basic Soup:<br />4 oz butter<br />1 large sweet onion (Spanish, vidalia)<br />3-1/4 c carrots (4 or 5, depending on size)<br />3-1/4 c rutabaga (large-it’s in the turnip family)<br />3-1/4 c butternut squash (buy cut up if possible)<br />4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />8 c chicken or vegetable stock (I use veg)<br />4 cloves smashed garlic<br />4 leaves fresh sage<br />healthy amount of peppercorns (10-12)<br />kosher (large grain) salt to your liking</p>
<p>Garnish:<br />1 c cheddar cheese (grated)<br />1/3 c toasted walnuts (or butternuts if you can find them)<br />1/4 c fresh thyme (remove leaves from stems)<br />3/4 c rutabaga (dice and steam)<br />3/4 c butternut squash (dice and steam)</p>
<p>1. Cut all veggies for soup into 2 inch chunks.</p>
<p>2. Melt butter in large skillet or soup pan. Add onions, garlic, rutabaga, and carrots and cook over medium heat until onions glisten (about 10 mins). Add squash, stock, thyme and sage (herbs tied for easy removal). Simmer until veggies are soft (20-30 mins, depending on size of your chunks).</p>
<p>3. Remove herbs. Puree in blender until smooth as silk. Return to heat. Stir in half-and-half and season to taste.</p>
<p>4. Put garnish in soup bowl and ladle soup over (or vice-versa). Can add chopped chives.</p>
<p><em>Can make this ahead and freeze. Also feel free to add parsnips, my fave soup veg, for extra sweetness.</em></p>

  <title>Only in New York (or maybe only Brooklyn)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The signature sound of Rosh Hashanah is the blare of air through a ram’s horn, the <em>shofar</em> in Hebrew. Insufficiently educated in Judaism, I would have to consult Jewishpedia (it exists?) to explain its significance. What I do know is that it is the emblem of this holiday.</p>
<p>So when a young man, 15 or 17 at the most (my daughter and I were of different minds), just approached us outside a coffee shop in Brooklyn and asked if we were Jewish, then asked if he could play the <em>shofar,</em> I said in as authentic a Yiddish accent as I could muster, So why not? (That was for dramatic effect only – I just said yes.)</p>
<p>He began by having me say two prayers, the first six words of which are inscribed in my brain because, so far as I know, every Jewish prayer begins with the same six words: <em>Baruch atah adonai elohenu melech ha-olam</em> and then I had to fudge it, pretending I knew where he was going. I hchuhched sufficiently to cover my ignorance. My daughter got to say Amen. Twice. At which point the young man sucked in a goodly amount of air and expelled it slowly and rhythmically through the pearly horn. Dressed in a black suit, white shirt, black hat with a broad rim, black shoes, and what looked like it might be a trendy tan t-shirt underneath, he blew through the shofar for a good long minute, and, when he was done, we thanked him and he us. We wished each other a Happy New Year and that our names would be inscribed in the Book of Life. May yours too.</p>
<p><em>And for those with a sense of humor, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTOdBzSpYc">Rosh Hashanah Girl.</a> </em></p>

  <title>Repost of July 10, 2011 post: Mo(u)rning has broken</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Strange things happen in blogland. Trying to fix a broken link earlier today on this post, originally written on July 10, 2011, it reposted as if it were written today. It wasn&#039;t. But it&#039;s still true:</em></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2011/06/jeffrey-spaulding-stamps-march-18-1944-june-11-2011.html" target="_self">Today marks 30 days</a>, the traditional grieving period for widows in Judaism. In Islam, it appears to be four lunar months and 10 days. I watched my beloved Tibetan Buddhist friend recite prayers (puja) for 49 days after her husband&#039;s death (<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2010/08/daja-wangchuk-mizu-meston-19702010.html" target="_self">a year ago tomorow</a>), the time it takes for the person to pass through one of the six &quot;bardos,&quot; the transitions between life and death... and life. I&#039;m keeping track of that marker too because of Jeff&#039;s deep interest in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
<p>None of this means that grieving is over. Having lost a fair number of people since I was very young, I know the sneak properties of grief, how just when you think it&#039;s not going to grab you by the throat again, it does, how seemingly insignificant things can trigger it, how anniversaries and big events and chance remarks and maybe even a chocolate brownie can set it off.</p>
<p>Still that initial period of becoming accustomed to the altered universe -- the absence -- has a way of shedding its shock value and that&#039;s where I am.</p>
<p>My old blog readers are aware that I&#039;ve posted practically nothing in the past few months. While I&#039;ve continued working through this whole period - including some novel and interesting projects, I&#039;ve lacked the urge to post, my mind consumed with what was ahead and what was happening right then, particularly in the last six weeks of Jeff&#039;s life.</p>
<p>So I offer this post as a gate to the next phase and a return to the many topics I&#039;ve felt compelled to cover in the past four years.</p>
<p>And I can&#039;t get this hymn out of my mind, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KqZBSP5t-o">performed by one of Jeff&#039;s favorite artists, Judy Collins</a>. Though the words don&#039;t all reflect what I&#039;m feeling, mo(u)rning has broken. [youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KqZBSP5t-o&amp;w=459&amp;h=344]&#160;</p>

    <wp:comment_content>My heart goes out to you as you continue on this difficult journey. I hadn't known Jeff died until Megan sent me the link to your blog. You were in our thoughts as we wrapped up the Bicentennial in May at the 201st celebration at West St. I'll be sending healing thoughts and prayers.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who question the power of networks, consider this. It was Mexico&#039;s &quot;network of 11 disease surveillance units&quot; that noticed the surge in cases of flu. Through simple pattern recognition across the network--when a critical mass of nodes shared information, epidemiologists were able to project doubling rates. See James F. Smith&#039;s article, &quot;<span style="font-size: 13px;font-family: Arial"><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2009/04/28/network_alerted_mexican_officials_to_flu/">Network alerted Mexican officials to flu</a>&quot; in The Boston Globe&#039;s April 28, 2009, issue. (Long live the Globe, lest we forget <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/04/was-todays-boston-sunday-globe-the-last-well-ever-see.html">that important story</a>, i.e. tomorrow is May 1, deadline day, so to speak.)</span></p>

    <wp:comment_content>Very good observation J-
if you apply Metcalfe's law to this -- you can see the power of the data transforming itself into highly valuable information not just useful (but truly lifesaving) and of essential importance.

What Is Metcalfe's Law?
Metcalfe's Law basically states the number of possible cross-connections in a network, and its inherent value, grows as the square of the number of computers in the network increases. In simpler terms, the value of a network with 2 members is equal to 4. And the value of a network with 4 members is equal to 16."

    <wp:comment_content>David, you broke the math.
Metcalf's 'law' asserts that the value added by a network grows in proportion to the number of pairwise connections it makes possible.
For large numbers, this grows roughly as the square of the node count of the network. Precisely, (N * (N - 1)) / 2.... Read More
But for a network of two nodes, there is but one pair, and for a network of four nodes there are six.
If you want to exemplify the square law growth, say "double the network size and you quadruple the value added." But don't do it in terms of trivially small networks, where it's technically wrong and for business purposes uninteresting.</wp:comment_content>

My hubby has been coming to <a href="http://www.bearisland.org">this paradise</a> since he was four; I started when I was 23, which means we’ve been walking from the east side of the island, just above The Carry, to the Mail Dock (where the <a href="http://cruisenh.com/MtWashington/day/MailCruises.php">M/V Sophie C,</a> the US mail boat delivers the daily post), on the west side, for 37 years. The first time each of our kids made the trek across the island is recorded in pencil on the window jam.</p>
<p>There is no bridge to the island, no roads, only footpaths. Back in the day, Bear Island was a destination for wealthy summer vacationers. A train from Boston brought people to a ferry, which was met by a horse carriage that transported guests up the pine path to the wide wrapping porch of the Bear Island Hotel.<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/hotelfront_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="62" border="0" alt="Hotelfront_2" title="Hotelfront_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hotelfront_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a> </p>
<p>Its foundation and a scattering of wrought iron frames and stoves remain strewn in the forest, a fire of dubious origin having burned down the hotel in the Great US Depression in the 1930s as its owner was seen leaving the island.
</p>
<p> When we put in a phone in the early '70s, we were one of only two camps in our &quot;village&quot; with such links to the outside world (the other at the lovely camp of &quot;the doctor&quot; on the point)--and our neighbors made fun of us. I thought we'd justified the installation by choosing a red phone - for emergencies only. That I regarded a phone as more important than indoor plumbing, which we didn't acquire until 1989, reveals a bit more about myself than perhaps I should :).</p>
<p>So yesterday, imagine this: high-speed internet was installed in our chicken coop, literally, yes, a chicken coop, hauled over sixty years ago on a barge by my father-in-law and his friend Seth, whose children &quot;live&quot; next door and remain our very closest of friends.</p>
<p>Yes, folks, wireless in paradise. Or is that an oxymoron?</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/bica2_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="81" border="0" alt="Bica2_2" title="Bica2_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bica2_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2010/01/19/top-five-trends-in-the-future-of-work/">Thoughtful piece</a> by Brent Frei on why work-at-a-distance works--and will work for eons to come. His trends are in the &quot;yes, of course,&quot; category (principally, technology advances from greater availability of broadband to use of mobile devices) but he manages to pick the best of the lot for his list; his predictions are, likewise, from the general pool of discussion about this but he finds the pick of the litter. Together, they should make the new class of migrant information workers who pack their portfolios with presentations past feel they&#039;re on the right track:</p><blockquote><p>1. Migration of professional people from high tax &amp; regulation states to low tax &amp; low regulation states.</p><p>2. Explosive expansion of work marketplaces and paid crowdsourcing for all kinds of jobs.</p><p>3. More productive people will work for themselves by shopping their
considerable talents around the world via work marketplaces.</p><p>4. Job performance and work quality will become transparent as people’s work is reviewed online much as products are today.</p><p>5. Average earnings for high performers will be more than double the average earnings in their category.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't have a category for this one but since it involves a friend, &quot;friends&quot; will have to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2007/12/the-honor-of-a.html">Nova Spivack</a>, our friend, seriously, has been named &quot;one of the sexiest men in IT,&quot; according to Margaret Rouse of <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/overheard/overheard-the-top-10-sexiest-men-in-it-2007/">IT Knowledge Exchange</a>. Look at who else in on the list: Gordon Moore, former chair and CEO of Intel; Tim Berners-Lee, granddaddy (though he's hardly old enough) of the web; and Larry Page, co-founder of Google. Another post will have to consider the criteria by which a man becomes sexy in IT...but perhaps for a less family-friendly blog.</p>
<p>In any event, Nova, congrats. What you've always yearned for, we know.</p>

  <title>Rules for Second Life</title>
  <link>https://kgnomad.wordpress.com/2007/07/27/rules-for-secon/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know what Second Life is, then this post's title makes sense -- and that would be 8 million of you (a mere fraction of my readers, of course). And if you've never heard of it, <a href="http://secondlife.com/">take a look</a>: In short, it's an online environment where you can buy virtual land, visit virtual places, make virtual friends, and, in the past couple of years, conduct meetings, go to concerts, even listen to candidates hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Turns out that a bunch of biggies, including IBM, have been scooping up virtual real estate and building their own online environments. We did a quick survey of what's out there for a client last year and were surprised to find how many companies are playing with this technology.</p>
<p>Ever the experimenter, I joined and spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get my bearings and figure out how to &quot;fit in.&quot; Having never played a video game beyond Frogger (oh, for those innocent days), I was a clumsy Second Lifer. Mainly, I felt like a rube. The &quot;clothing&quot; that comes with signing on left me feeling a lot like my grandmother must have when she stepped off the boat from Rotterdam onto Ellis Island. The previous immigrants had hip, imaginative appearances. I was from the Old Country.</p>
<p>But, alas, it's a generous world and a &quot;woman&quot; (she could have been a hermaphrodite, no way to tell, but her avatar was a woman) from Denmark (or Mars, again...) sent me a text message, offering me some hand-me-downs. Quickly, I looked a bit more like a native.</p>
<p>OK, back to The Rules. IBM has issued <a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html">some guidelines</a> for its 5000 virtual employees. Well, I guess they're actual employees participating virtually. From Rachel Konrad's article and with thanks to Eric Bedell's superb <a href="http://thiswebday.com/">This Web Day</a> for the pointer (hi, Eric!):</p><blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span></span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><p>
IBM's rules - which apply to &quot;Second Life,&quot;&quot;Entropia
Universe,&quot;&quot;Forterra,&quot; There.com and other worlds - are logical
extensions of the real world: Don't discuss intellectual property with
unauthorized people. Don't discriminate or harass.</p>
<p>
Guidelines also include a 21st-century version of the Golden Rule: &quot;Be a good 3D Netizen.&quot;</p>
<p>
Other rules are unique to the metaverse, which requires users to create
animated avatars with distinct appearances, personalities and gestures.
&quot;Second Life,&quot; owned by San Francisco-based Linden Lab, has more than 8
million avatars; most look human, but many take the form of chipmunks,
zombies or fantastic beasts.</p>
<p>
IBM, whose 20th century employees were parodied as corporate cogs in
matching navy suits, doesn't have an avatar dress code. But guidelines
suggest being &quot;especially sensitive to the appropriateness of your
avatar or persona's appearance when you are meeting with IBM clients or
conducting IBM business.&quot;</p>
<p>
Rules caution workers who have multiple avatars or frequently change
their avatar's appearance. It's common to have numerous avatars -
similar to having multiple <a target="_blank" href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html#" class="iAs" style="border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent;padding-bottom: 1px">e-mail</a> addresses for work and personal use.</p>
<p>
&quot;Building a reputation of trust within a virtual world represents a
commitment to be truthful and accountable with fellow digital
citizens,&quot; IBM states. &quot;Dramatically altering, splitting or abandoning
your digital persona may be a violation of that trust. ... In the case
of a digital persona used for IBM business purposes, it may violate
your obligations to IBM.&quot;</p></span></span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

I tend to agree, though I have not re-created my bald spot. Those blue-suited IBM&#x27;ers served a purpose: When you&#x27;re selling power and reliability, it&#x27;s not a bad thing for your clothes to tell that story. It&#x27;s no different from an Apple executive in a black turtleneck, where the message is controlled creativity.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Pesha Linden <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— July 28, 2007 at 02:00 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Lefy, if not for you, who knows how long it would have taken me to find Second Life? So here&#x27;s one place it gets tricky: Pajamanation. Even if you work at IBM, you might be typing away, say, in a top that says &quot;yoga&quot; and your sweats, the ones with the holes in the knees that you really love.</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content>Some have suggested that avatars deployed for business should look as much like their owners as possible. I tend to agree, though I have not re-created my bald spot. Those blue-suited IBM'ers served a purpose: When you're selling power and reliability, it's not a bad thing for your clothes to tell that story. It's no different from an Apple executive in a black turtleneck, where the message is controlled creativity.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Lefy, if not for you, who knows how long it would have taken me to find Second Life? So here's one place it gets tricky: Pajamanation. Even if you work at IBM, you might be typing away, say, in a top that says "yoga" and your sweats, the ones with the holes in the knees that you really love.</wp:comment_content>

It&#039;s taking quite a bit of self-control not to clip one and put it here. Feel free, Jonathan.</p><br />

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Sampson, the New Zealand based collaboration expert, is tireless. Today, <a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/2007/08/enterprise-co-1.html">another catalog of posts </a>on the people side of collaboration and virtual teams. If you're new to this area, it's worth clicking through to all the links Michael lists as this post is chockful of good thinking. If you're an old-timer, you might find yourself going directly to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2007/work.at.home/dilbert/">Dilbert on Telecommuting.</a></p>
<p>To be honest, I haven't communed with Dilbert for a very long time but this set of cartoons is positively prescient. How many people (other than us and a handful of our friends) truly were telecommuting in 1995? That said, Dilbert's notion of skipping the act of dressing while working from home flies in the face of the advice from the <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/the-only-person.html">WIRED issue</a> that I mentioned a few days ago. WIRED says the Full Monty is hardly the way to go. Get dressed as if you're going to work, WIRED recommends. Yeah, right.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#039;t typically use the same titles as other people&#039;s posts except when they are so good that the post itself is addendum. Such is the case with <a href="http://blog.heekya.com/2009/01/storytelling-adds-human-touch-to_23.html">David Adewumi&#039;s reposting</a> of Kathy Hansen&#039;s original one about the value of stories to virtual team success, which David posted to <a href="http://blog.heekya.com">Heekya</a> yesterday. When people are not together, they have to work hard with all available tools to stay connected and committed. Storytelling does that--and Kathy Hansen has been collecting up some very good stories of storytellers on her blog, <a href="http://www.astoriedcareer.com/">A Storied Career</a>.</p><p>When the (good) leader of a (good) conference call begins by throwing out a question -- for example, &quot;What did you have for dinner last night?&quot; -- that wise person is evoking stories from the group. We can picture the bowl of pasta, the leftover soup, the drive-through where the fries spilled onto someone&#039;s lap, the baby hurling the sippy cup. Stories. They keep us whole and human and, yes, connected.</p><p>Here&#039;s a pull from Heekya&#039;s repost, mentioning our book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471388254/netagethenetworkA">Virtual Teams</a> and referring to <a href="http://www.astoriedcareer.com/jessica_lipnack_qa.html">the interview</a> I did last summer with A Storied Career:</p><p style="margin: 1em 0pt 3px 40px;line-height: 115%"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px">I
got interested in virtual teams and virtual work a few years ago when I
learned that some of my former students felt that, while their
business-school education had prepared them well to collaborate in
face-to-face teams, it fell short in readying them to participate on
geographically dispersed teams in which very little interaction was
face-to-face. As a result of this finding, I developed a well-received
virtual-teams project in my business-communication classes. It was at
about this same time that my interest in storytelling was burgeoning;
thus, I&#039;m quite interested in convergences between virtual work and
storytelling.</span><br /> </p><p style="margin-left: 40px"><span style="display: inline"></span>That&#039;s one reason I was so delighted when I discovered that Jessica
Lipnack, co-author of probably the definitive book on virtual teams,
was also a member of Worldwide Story Work. In her <a href="http://www.astoriedcareer.com/jessica_lipnack_qa.html">Q&amp;A with A Storied Career</a>, she <a href="http://astoriedcareer.com/2008/09/qa-with-a-story-guru-jessica-l-2.html" target="_blank">discussed the value of storytelling in virtual teams</a>.</p><p>Thanks so very much, David, and, of course, Kathy, and, everyone, take a look at <a href="http://www.astoriedcareer.com/">A Storied Career</a> and <a href="http://heekya.com">Heekya</a>, &quot;a social storytelling platform that will change the way you create, share, and discover stories.&quot; </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pickles and ice cream. Two famous foodies from our hometown get shouted out in NY Times food section today: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/dining/20brooklyn.html?_r=1&amp;src=twr&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=jon%20orren&amp;st=cse" target="_self">Jon Orren</a> of <a href="http://wheelhousepickles.com/" target="_self">Wheelhouse Pickles</a> and Jennifer Dundas of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/dining/20fcal.html?src=twrhp&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=blue%20marble&amp;st=cse" target="_self">Blue Marble Ice Cream</a>, both for their association with our fave part of NY--Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Jon, previously profiled <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/02/local-boy-makes-goodpickles-and-makes-the-ny-times.html" target="_self">here</a>, gets the mention for his interview in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061956228/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0394584171&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=05QN49J706BW1YER95GM" target="_self"><em>The New Brooklyn Cookbook</em>.</a></p>
<p>Jennie (mentioned by store not personal name this time and previously profiled <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/10/i-can-now-vouch-for-the-chocolate-ice-cream-at-blue-marble-in-brooklyn-speclicious-even-better-than-that-take-a-look-at.html" target="_self">here</a> and <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/11/ice-cream-for-rwanda.html" target="_self">here</a>) gets the spotlight for the event this coming Sunday at Blue Marble on Atlantic Ave. The store (a chain now, so wildly successful that distribution demands one less retail outlet) is closing this location with a party benefiting Sweet Dreams, the owners&#039; ice cream shop in Rwanda. From the Times:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Blue Marble Ice Cream is closing its store at 420 Atlantic Avenue (Bond  Street), Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and on Sunday from 7 to 11 p.m. there  will be a party there, with food, sparkling wine and ice cream, to  benefit Sweet Dreams, an ice cream shop in Rwanda, which the owners of  Blue Marble have opened; $25 a person or $50 a family at the door.</p>

  <title>Sad to see you go, BostonNow</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/16/bostonnow_logo_blue.jpg"></a><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/16/bostonnow_logo_blue_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="174" border="0" alt="Bostonnow_logo_blue_2" title="Bostonnow_logo_blue_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bostonnow_logo_blue_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a></p>
<p>Sorry to learn that BostonNow, the free local paper that had built its circulation to 119,000 in just a year, has shut down. <a href="http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2008/04/14/bostonnow-to-shut-down-immediately">According to the notice on the site</a>, &quot;rapidly deteriorating economic conditions&quot; are the cause. <a href="http://media.www.jsons.org/media/storage/paper139/news/2008/01/01/BostonNewEngland/Bostonnow.Shuts.Down-3324390.shtml">JSONS</a>, Journalism Students Online News Service, goes into more detail about the paper's financing:</p><blockquote><p>Current financial problems faced by its prime investor, an Iceland
based company called Bauger-Group, triggered BostonNOW's closing. Last
week, Bauger-Group sold all of its media holdings to Dagsbrun Media,
which in turn shut down BostonNOW.</p></blockquote><p>We here at Endless Knots, being me in thoroughly self-referential form, are particularly sad as I'd been named a &quot;featured blogger&quot; on the site, meaning I was listed on its homepage. Just a week ago, they'd contacted me, asking for pictures and permission to use my name and image in an advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The exposure was great. Every day, I posted here and on BostonNow, which meant that I had even more readers. A number of my posts were chosen for reprinting in the paper as well. So good for us bloggers and quite sad for those working at the paper.</p>
<p>You'll be missed. And thanks, editors, for all the efforts.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, Boston Globe. Today&#039;s editorial, &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/01/31/time_to_hang_up_and_drive/">Time to hang up and drive</a>,&quot; puts into numbers what I&#039;ve been harping on (&quot;<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/01/seriously-get-out-off-the-flippin-phone.html">Seriously, get off the flippin&#039; phone</a>&quot;). Please, please. Do as I&#039;ve done and, as the Globe says: &quot;Friends don&#039;t let friends drive drunk. It is time to say friends also don&#039;t let friends yak on the cell or text-message on the Crackberry at the wheel.&quot;</p><p>One friend has stopped calling me from his car - but it&#039;s because, as he admitted in a weak moment, he&#039;s still offending. Here are some sobering stats from the Globe:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">THE EVIDENCE won&#039;t let drivers off the hook. It is time for a total ban on all cellphone use while driving.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">The
federally chartered National Safety Council recently called for a
national ban on cellphone use, whether hand-held or hands-free. It
cited a 2003 Harvard risk analysis estimating cellphones are involved
in 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries, and 2,600 deaths a year.</p><br />

<hr style="margin: 2em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ddd;"/><div class="legacy-comments" style="background-color:#f8f9fa; padding:1.5em; border-radius:6px;"><h4 style="color:#666;">Comments from Original Post</h4><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Gabriel Orgrease <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— January 31, 2009 at 05:43 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">In NYS where I live the law is hands-free but it is hard to drive anywhere without finding someone blatantly and obviously driving with a cell phone held to their ear. The waggle of the vehicle on the road and then the tilt of the head are good signs.<br/>I commuted 5 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12 years by driving alone. I have experience using a cell phone while driving. The point that I am at now I really DO NOT like to use the cell phone, with bluetooth earpiece, at all whenever driving. When using the cell phone I do not pay as good attention to the road as needed, I forget what I am doing, and I often find myself suddenly lost or not where I intended to go. It is fine that some drivers think they have a right to use their cell phone, but honestly I think that they are delusional to presume that they have any clue what it is doing to their driving proficiency or habits.<br/>I have also gotten very good at shutting off my cellphone when commuting on the train.<br/>A point of the &#x27;addiction&#x27; of cell phone use is this compulsion that we need to be instantly available. Fact is we do not need to be available most of the time at all, ever. I relish those establishments where cell phone usage is banned. An oasis of escape from instant inter connectivity... which goes to a point that healthy human networks need down time, like humans that need sleep.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">jessica lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— January 31, 2009 at 06:03 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Gabriel, you&#x27;re so right. The bits about getting lost, not really paying attention, and the need for downtime are exactly the issues. Thanks for this comment. I hope many people read it. If you read my previous post on this, you see why I&#x27;m on a rip.<br/>I was just out and about - saw one driver after another with that glazed over look, head tilted sideways, and...of course swerving. Maybe we need to sign a pledge.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Dorothy Dundas <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— January 31, 2009 at 07:00 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Dorothy Dundas at 6:33pm January 31<br/>I think research says that, yes, while driving it is just as dangerous to talk without holding the cell phone as it is holding it. Has to do with using certain parts of your brain which are different from the parts used while talking with someone sitting next to you or listening to the radio............many are killed driving while talking hands-free........but let&#x27;s have a brain research person add details to this discussion.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">jessica lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— January 31, 2009 at 08:19 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">So interesting, Dorothy. Just found a Carnegie Mellon report on attention and cell phone use: "...the Carnegie Mellon study, for the first time, used brain imaging to document that listening alone reduces by 37 percent the amount of brain activity associated with driving. This can cause drivers to weave out of their lane, based on the performance of subjects using a driving simulator.

    <wp:comment_content>In NYS where I live the law is hands-free but it is hard to drive anywhere without finding someone blatantly and obviously driving with a cell phone held to their ear. The waggle of the vehicle on the road and then the tilt of the head are good signs.
I commuted 5 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12 years by driving alone. I have experience using a cell phone while driving. The point that I am at now I really DO NOT like to use the cell phone, with bluetooth earpiece, at all whenever driving. When using the cell phone I do not pay as good attention to the road as needed, I forget what I am doing, and I often find myself suddenly lost or not where I intended to go. It is fine that some drivers think they have a right to use their cell phone, but honestly I think that they are delusional to presume that they have any clue what it is doing to their driving proficiency or habits.
I have also gotten very good at shutting off my cellphone when commuting on the train.
A point of the 'addiction' of cell phone use is this compulsion that we need to be instantly available. Fact is we do not need to be available most of the time at all, ever. I relish those establishments where cell phone usage is banned. An oasis of escape from instant inter connectivity... which goes to a point that healthy human networks need down time, like humans that need sleep.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Gabriel, you're so right. The bits about getting lost, not really paying attention, and the need for downtime are exactly the issues. Thanks for this comment. I hope many people read it. If you read my previous post on this, you see why I'm on a rip.
I was just out and about - saw one driver after another with that glazed over look, head tilted sideways, and...of course swerving. Maybe we need to sign a pledge.</wp:comment_content>

I think research says that, yes, while driving it is just as dangerous to talk without holding the cell phone as it is holding it. Has to do with using certain parts of your brain which are different from the parts used while talking with someone sitting next to you or listening to the radio............many are killed driving while talking hands-free........but let's have a brain research person add details to this discussion.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>So interesting, Dorothy. Just found a Carnegie Mellon report on attention and cell phone use: "...the Carnegie Mellon study, for the first time, used brain imaging to document that listening alone reduces by 37 percent the amount of brain activity associated with driving. This can cause drivers to weave out of their lane, based on the performance of subjects using a driving simulator.
The findings, to be reported in an upcoming issue of the journal Brain Research, show that making cell phones hands-free or voice-activated is not sufficient in eliminating distractions to drivers. 'Drivers need to keep not only their hands on the wheel; they also have to keep their brains on the road," said neuroscientist Marcel Just, director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging.'"

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if Gil Yehuda's post were awful (it's anything but), I'd still want to blog it just for <a href="http://www.gilyehuda.com/2009/07/24/getting-off-the-email-hamster-wheel/">this title</a>. We all complain about email but who does anything about it? OK, a few people (loud clearing of throat)...which prompts me to post this single slide about how to radically improve your use of email.</p>
<p>And, sugest that you read Gil's post where he reviews Mike Song, Vicki Halsey, and Tim Burress's book, <em><a href="http://www.cohesiveknowledge.com/HamsterRevolution.htm">The Hamster Revolution</a></em>, apparently about information overload and, yes, email management.</p>
<p>Song et al's book, according to Gil's post, has some good tips, including this really simple one:</p><blockquote><p>All emails have a Subject, Action, Background, and Close. &nbsp;All meeting
requests have Subject, Location, and Time (provided by the email client
— e.g. Outlook, Notes, etc.) &nbsp;as well as Objective, Agenda, Logistics,
and Prep-work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only. Life would be so simple...and thanks, Gil. Great post. Our billboard messages on email:</p><br />

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One beauty of humanity is our ability to celebrate the New Year in just about every month of the year. In a few hours, the year 5769 begins according to the Jewish calendar and we'll be celebrating with our beloved family and friends. Even if you're not Jewish, please join us in raising a toast tonight to new beginnings and in giving thanks for the joys of the past one. For me, I'm grateful for spending time with the people I love most, especially the immense amount of time I've been able to hang out with our children particularly in the past few months, for the new friends I've made both personally and through my work, for being able to speak honestly even when it's been uncomfortable, and for having the time to write, garden, and do yoga, three gifts that make me very happy.</p>
<p>None of us can ignore how difficult this year has been, and, especially, how scary things are right now. I have a dear friend who may lose her house, another who will be deployed to Iraq in a few weeks, another whom we were lucky to visit with today who just lost her husband, and another who is quite ill. I know all reading here can add to this list. What can we do? We can remember to always say &quot;I love you,&quot; be more forgiving moment by moment, and tell jokes. I wish I had one at the ready but, sentimental me, I'm in the teary space.</p>
<p>I leave you for the next day or so with a few snapshots from the opening of <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/09/building-steam.html">Building Steam</a>, where our daughter, <a href="http://elizastamps.com">Eliza,</a> showed a new piece that caused more than a few wows. When we have a really good shot of the drawing, I'll post that. Meanwhile, here are a few shots that show its detail and in the last photo, one that shows its size with the artist and her father.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some heartening research for introverts. In this age of collaboration (telecommuting, virtual teams, remote working, etc), we might take a page from people who spend time alone (and not like this-alone, at the computer), according to &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/03/06/the_power_of_lonely/" target="_self">The power of lonely</a>&quot; by Leon Neyfakh in yesterday&#039;s Boston Globe. Witness these gems (and forgiveness please for not spending more time--alone--throwing in all my thoughts about this; have to go meet some people...):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[A]n emerging body of research is  suggesting that spending time alone,  if done right, can be good for us —  that certain tasks and thought  processes are best carried out without  anyone else around, and that  even the most socially motivated among us  should regularly be taking  time to ourselves if we want to have fully  developed personalities, and  be capable of focus and creative thinking.  There is even research to  suggest that blocking off enough alone time is  an important component  of a well-functioning social life — that if we  want to get the most out  of the time we spend with people, we should  make sure we’re spending  enough of it away from them. Just as regular  exercise and healthy  eating make our minds and bodies work better,  solitude experts say, so  can being alone.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">One  ongoing Harvard study indicates that people form more lasting  and  accurate memories if they believe they’re experiencing something  alone.  Another indicates that a certain amount of solitude can make a  person  more capable of empathy towards others. And while no one would  dispute  that too much isolation early in life can be unhealthy, a  certain amount  of solitude has been shown to help teenagers improve  their moods and  earn good grades in school...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">...In an age when no one is ever more than a text message or an e-mail away  from other people, the distinction between “alone” and “together” has  become hopelessly blurry, even as the potential benefits of true  solitude are starting to become clearer...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">...When we let our focus shift away from the people and things around us,  we are better able to engage in what’s called meta-cognition, or the  process of thinking critically and reflectively about our own thoughts...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">...Teenagers, especially, whose personalities have not yet fully formed,  have been shown to benefit from time spent apart from others, in part  because it allows for a kind of introspection — and freedom from  self-consciousness — that strengthens their sense of identity...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[According to Univ of Illinois Professor Reed Larson,] teenagers weren’t necessarily happier when they were alone;  adolescence, after all, can be a particularly tough time to be separated  from the group. But Larson found something interesting: On average, the  kids in his sample felt better after they spent some time alone than  they did before.</p>
<div>
<p>And lest we forget:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The leaders of the world’s great religions — Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed,  Moses — all had crucial revelations during periods of solitude.</p>

Crash blossoms happen when we mistake nouns for verbs and v/v, taken from this perfect example: &quot;Violinist Linked to JAL Crash Blossoms.&quot; Well done, Ben Zimmer of NY Times.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that while the Digital Age is upon us fast and furious, the print newspaper -- hereafter dubbed the "snailpaper" -- shall persevere as a good daily read, a fascinating look at the world around us and a valuable tool for understanding oped pundits and above the fold headlines. Sure, the dear snailpaper will also be seen as a useful tool
for wrapping fish at the Fulton Fish Market or lining the bird cage in the den, but all kidding aside -- har! har! -- the daily snailpaper can hold its head high and be certain of its place in the culture. While news migrates in pixels and bytes to the Internet at an exponential rate, piling breaking story upon breaking story and turning everyone and his mother into a 24/7 news freak and RSS aggregator, the plodding snailpaper will nevertheless remain the bedrock of analysis and insight, from sea to shining sea, delivered at a snail's pace, yes, read at a snail's pace, yes, and absorbed, word for word -- on glorius printed paper! white newsprint reflecting inked letters! -- at a snail's pace, yes, as long as the Republic of Letters shall live."

danny in Taiwan
IF you really want to post one day on soemthing VERy interesting, it's my polar cities ideas and iamges here,,,,,about future climate chaos and surival and i am an optimist.....!
<a href="http://pcillu101.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow ugc">http://pcillu101.blogspot.com</a>
it's funny to me, the NY Times will write about my silly crash blossoms coinage, which is not important and was a joke to begin with, but the Times will not write about snailpapers, i asked them and they said, as a good snailpaper, get lost! -- and they won't write about my polar cities ideas either, even as mere speculation which is all they are... it's not easy being a mirthful visionary....with no PHD or connections....story of my life
SMILE
and i love life! i can see you to do. enjoy the enjoy. that is what we are here for!
keep posting, love your blog, love your POV..... i call my own blogs as scrapblogs, since they are more like scrapbooks than real blogs....i am not really a blogger, i am more of a scrappy scrapblogger. Yo!</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">dan bloom <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— February 06, 2010 at 09:32 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">I see by the snailpapers in Britain that a major literary agent has signed up a top journo there to write an &quot;on language&quot; type of book about CRASH BLOSSOMS in the English-language media the world over, for publication in 2012 -- and advance of US$25,000 is being reported, the writer keeping low profile, book capitalizing on Ben Zimmer&#x27;s recent New York Times &quot;On Language&quot; article about said &quot;crash blossoms&quot; and how they, er, bloomed, er, blossomed ..... THE BOOK SHOULD BE A WINNER! BRAVO!<br/>No, the book won&#x27;t be Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim, and Other Flubs from the Nation&#x27;s Press published by Columbia Journal in 1980, before the term &quot;crash blossoms&quot; bloomed, and no, it won&#x27;t be titled Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge a 1987 tome by Gloria Cooper. The title of the Crash Blossoms book is still tentative but for sure CRASH BLOSSOMS will appear in the title. Any suggestions for what to call this book? I will forward them on to the literary agent, the editor and the author.<br/>The book also will not be titled Anguished English: An Anthology of Accidental Assaults Upon Our Language which Richard Lederer did in 1987.</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

it's funny to me, the NY Times will write about my silly crash blossoms coinage, which is not important and was a joke to begin with, but the Times will not write about snailpapers, i asked them and they said, as a good snailpaper, get lost! -- and they won't write about my polar cities ideas either, even as mere speculation which is all they are... it's not easy being a mirthful visionary....with no PHD or connections....story of my life
SMILE
and i love life! i can see you to do. enjoy the enjoy. that is what we are here for!
keep posting, love your blog, love your POV..... i call my own blogs as scrapblogs, since they are more like scrapbooks than real blogs....i am not really a blogger, i am more of a scrappy scrapblogger. Yo!</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>I see by the snailpapers in Britain that a major literary agent has signed up a top journo there to write an "on language" type of book about CRASH BLOSSOMS in the English-language media the world over, for publication in 2012 -- and advance of US$25,000 is being reported, the writer keeping low profile, book capitalizing on Ben Zimmer's recent New York Times "On Language" article about said "crash blossoms" and how they, er, bloomed, er, blossomed ..... THE BOOK SHOULD BE A WINNER! BRAVO!
No, the book won't be Squad Helps Dog Bite Victim, and Other Flubs from the Nation's Press published by Columbia Journal in 1980, before the term "crash blossoms" bloomed, and no, it won't be titled Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge a 1987 tome by Gloria Cooper. The title of the Crash Blossoms book is still tentative but for sure CRASH BLOSSOMS will appear in the title. Any suggestions for what to call this book? I will forward them on to the literary agent, the editor and the author.
The book also will not be titled Anguished English: An Anthology of Accidental Assaults Upon Our Language which Richard Lederer did in 1987.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks for this Jessica - I'll push back too, please let us know if you obtain a copy of the report.
I do think however that the key sentence in the article is this one:
"People treat [virtual] teams the same, but they have to be managed differently. You can't just assume it's business as usual."
That part is most definitely true!</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Harvard launches Margaret</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When she lived, women could not study at Harvard. Her gaining admission to use its libraries was a first. So when <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/margaret-fuller-bicentennial/">Margaret Fuller&#039;s Bicentennial</a> was launched last Thursday in Harvard&#039;s <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/index.cfm">Houghton Library</a>, the event all but sank with meaning.</p><p>The Houghton is the Little Library that Corning Glass Works built. It&#039;s where Harvard houses its rare books and manuscripts. It&#039;s gorgeous. The room where Margaret&#039;s exhibit is laid out (it&#039;s on display until March 25) is the Amy Lowell Room, which houses Lowell&#039;s personal library. (I noticed her paperback edition of <em>Typee</em>.) Across the hall is an extraordinary collection of the work of Samuel Johnson, amassed over sixty years by Donald and Mary Hyde (principally by her as she outlived her first husband by nearly forty years) in another spectacular room. And on it goes. I felt as if I were back at Oxford. (Which, of course, was pictured in the Johnson room, a ceiling painting of Pembroke College, attended, naturally, by my hubby.)</p><p>Now for the program itself: Heather Cole, assistant curator at the Houghton, welcomed an astonishingly large crowd. Imagine ninety people showing up in the year 2147 (when mine will be--get ready) without benefit of much publicity on a very cold winter night. Dorothy Emerson, co-chair of the MF Bicentennial <a href="http://margaretfuller.org">in New England</a>, followed, explaining the year of activities we have planned. I, as the other co-chair, was up next, and I&#039;m not sure what I said except there was a lot of smiling involved, including my being able to mention that I&#039;d named <a href="http://turkeynose.com">Daughter #1</a> for a character in Margaret&#039;s writing and that I could point out said daughter as she happened to be standing in the doorway as she was visiting from New York with her tiny <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/lake-and-finn/">twin sons</a>, who also came to honor Margaret (they reclined for the festivities...).</p><p>Then the main performance, a brilliant, funny, and insightful talk by guest curator, Rob Velella, on Margaret as more than a feminist. It&#039;s my favorite view of her. Feminist, without doubt, but any hackneyed, misguided view of &quot;women first&quot; feminism does not square with Margaret&#039;s view (never mind that of most thoughtful people writing about women). Rob managed to capture the very best of Margaret in a quite succinct way, while lobbing in some of my very favorite of her quotes (for example, bloggers, &quot;If you have knowledge, let others light their candles with it&quot;) and, all the while, explaining why he&#039;d chosen the pieces he had for the four-cabinet exhibit. Rob, please publish your talk--and give it many times more. You get Margaret.</p><p>Now the exhibit: The Dial issue in which Margaret&#039;s signature essay, &quot;The Great Lawsuit: Man vs Men, Woman vs Women,&quot; along with the first edition of the essay as the book, <em>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</em>; a letter she wrote; an essay (or something, sorry for imprecision) from her diaries where Emerson scribbled some, as I recall, admonishing words across the top; a lock of her hair, in a curl, lighter brown that I&#039;d ever imagined.</p><p>And more. I need to go back and commune with this extraordinary display of certain remarkable bits from the life of this woman who has no peer.</p><p><em>NB: There are no pictures with this post because the Houghton doesn&#039;t allow pictures to be taken. I understand but I wish it had been different.</em></p><p></p>

It&#039;s <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a> Day in honor of the world&#039;s first known programmer, Augusta Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace, and, yes, daughter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron">Lord Byron</a>, yes, that Byron, the Romantic poet.</p><p>Though she lived only 36 years and those were in the 19th century (nearly the same years in fact as <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/fuller_family/">Margaret Fuller</a> lived about whom much has been written here), Ada Lovelace did something no one else had ever done: she proposed &quot;a method for calculating <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_numbers" title="Bernoulli numbers">Bernoulli numbers</a> with the Engine,&quot; the &quot;engine&quot; being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>&#039;s Analytical Engine. Thus was born the world&#039;s first computer program, long before there actually was a computer and a full century before &quot;software&quot; was even much of a concept.</p><p>Incredibly, Ada Lovelace&#039;s groundbreaking work was nothing more than a set of notes that she appended to the translation of an Italian mathematician&#039;s memoir. But what notes they were, a sequence of instructions for making calculations with Babbage&#039;s device. And she went on to postulate that the engine, once programmed, as it were, “might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.”</p><p>If you&#039;re interested, you can find a ton of material about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ms. Lovelace</a> around the web and at <a href="http://findingada.com/who-was-ada/">the site</a> set up for today&#039;s celebration of her impact: bloggers around the world are participating in a &quot;let&#039;s celebrate women in technology&quot; day, each of us raising up someone whom we admire.</p><p><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d0883401156e4c53c7970c-pi" style="float: left"><img alt="Lisahead-2b" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401156e4c53c7970c " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mt_imported_image_1757842239.jpg" style="margin: 5px" title="Lisahead-2b" /></a>
So with that background, I&#039;m honoring the great, once, and future networker, <a href="http://www.groupjazz.com/html/gj-the-crew.html">Lisa Kimball</a>. I met Lisa in the early &#039;80s, when computer conferencing was just taking off. She was then joining Frank Burns in launching <a href="http://community.tmn.com/">The Meta Network</a>, an online discussion forum that has lasted ever since.</p><p>Thousands -- I&#039;m not exaggerating -- thousands of conversations have been launched because of Lisa, who has the gift of online facilitation so needed today when digital &quot;conversations&quot; can be so reckless. She knows countless people in diverse fields. She&#039;s brilliant. She&#039;s funny. And she has the largest collections of Mexican folk art in any single residence (OK, I&#039;m probably exaggerating because hers is the only one I&#039;m familiar with but, trust me, it&#039;s immense.)</p><p>Professional-wise, her bio includes this: &quot;executive producer and owner of Group Jazz, an organization devoted to
supporting the efforts of teams, task forces, communities and
organizations. She earned her doctorate in educational psychology,
cognition and learning and is active in online community work,
organizational development and is skilled in using complexity-inspired
principles. She is also a Plexus Trustee.&quot; The also part is important as Lisa&#039;s been quite involved in Plexus Institute&#039;s work with hospitals and health care facilities to apply &quot;Positive
Deviance methodology&quot; to &quot;eliminating transmission of
hospital acquired &#039;superbug&#039; infections.&quot;</p><p>It&#039;s fitting. Lisa&#039;s always positive, always making connections you wouldn&#039;t necessarily think of yourself. She&#039;s a cofounder of the long-ago but not-forgotten <a href="http://cgi.gjhost.com/%7Ecgi/mt/netweaverarchive/cat_electronic_networking_association.html">Electronic Networking Association</a> (I was there at the founding meeting too and get to call myself a co-founder but really Lisa did more work than anyone.)</p><p>I&#039;ve <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.chttp://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/11/biology-and-high-performance-teams-conference-call.html">written</a> about <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/10/the-life-of-the.html">Lisa</a> before <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/06/some-history-of.html">here</a> and <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/02/metanet-at-25.html">here</a>. So admiring have we been of her networking talents that we profiled her in <em><a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/books/download_age.htm">The Age of the Network</a></em> (&quot;<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/internetweb/page/2/www.netage.com/pub/books/AgeNet/CHAPTERS%20PDF/CHAPTER7.pdf">All the Way to New York to Buy a Modem</a>&quot;).</p><p>And why do we have the (*lisa) in the title? Because for many years, that&#039;s how she signed her emails.</p><p>Keep networking, Lisa. It&#039;s more than technology alone that builds the future.</p><p>PS: One tiny last thing: I trust Lisa so much that when I couldn&#039;t fulfill a speaking engagement in Japan, I turned it over to her - and they loved her.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the first snow falls, my inner cook wants to make this family favorite. Vegans, vegetarians, don't despair: I worked through an adaptation with my vegetable daughter recently, notes below at Step 7A.</p>
<p><em>Beef and Barley Soup</em></p>
<p>12 servings</p>
<p>3 lbs short ribs (use more if you like a meatier soup)<br />6 carrots <br />3 turnips (or parsnips or combo of both) <br />1 large cipolline onion (or 3 small or substitute another sweet onion)<br />3 shallots<br />1 leek<br />4 cloves of garlic<br />1 cup capellini beans (or other white bean, soaked overnight)<br />1 cup barley<br />bay leaf<br />1 strip of Kombu (or other seaweed - this is critical if making the veg version)<br />Salt and pepper as desired</p>
<p>1. Trim as much fat as possible from short ribs. Reserve a small portion of fat, cut into very thin slices, and use to grease bottom of large stock pot. Add a little olive oil to make sure the whole bottom of pan is coated and that you're not increasing your cholesterol intake unreasonably (just reasonably).</p>
<p>2. Add crushed garlic and cook for a minute or two, until the kitchen smells great.</p>
<p>3. Add short ribs and sear on all sides (about 10 minutes, turning side to side).</p>
<p>4. Dice all veggies while searing meat.</p>
<p>5. Cover meat with about 12 cups of water. If it doesn't look like enough, add more. Add salt.</p>
<p>6. Bring to boil and skim (before pot boils over, a delicate moment).</p>
<p>7. Add veggies, beans, barley, bay leaf, Kombu strip, and other herbs (dried or fresh if you have them, your choice).</p>
<p>7A. If making veggie version, add a can of tomatoes (also OK for meat version), another strip of Kombu, and four more cloves of whole garlic, slightly crushed.</p>
<p>8. Simmer for three hours.</p>
<p>9. Correct seasoning.</p>
<p>Serve with salad and crusty bread. And say thanks again to my mother, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/09/love-each-other.html">Ethel,</a> the queen of this soup.</p>

  <title>Scene 6: Too many questions</title>
  <link>https://kgnomad.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/scene-6-too-many-questions/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#039;s a suggestion for the people who think up the routines for patient room visits by medical staff. Step back for a second and try to consider things from the patients&#039; perspective.</p><p>What am I talking about? &quot;My person&quot; is visited by many people every day, a large number of whom ask precisely the same questions. Not <em>sort of</em> the same questions but <em>precisely</em> the same questions. Among those who pose these questions: doctors, nurses, fellows, residents, interns, and medical students.</p><p>This process is both the way that staff learns what&#039;s going on and also provides necessary education for the students. I respect this. But when the questions begin by waking patients up to ask them, only to have another person come in, say, 15 minutes later to ask the same thing, then something is not quite right.</p><p>A few days ago, my person respectfully asked that the medical students at least come in <em>with</em> the residents so that there were fewer interruptions in the early morning (by which I mean 5:30 am). Thus, a note was taped to the door saying something along the lines that medical students should consult the nurses before coming into the room.</p><p>I&#039;m not sure what happened but my person, who&#039;s had very little sleep in the past few days due to protracted testing late into the night plus the beloved dawn interrogations, was trying to take a nap this afternoon when a medical student knocked loudly and came into the room. I don&#039;t believe this person did stop at the desk to ask for permission because she made quite a bit of noise, even as I tried to fend her off. Regardless, she started to ask the very same questions that had been asked barely 45 minutes earlier...even as she could see the patient was sleeping.</p><p>Perhaps she was embarrassed. I don&#039;t know but she made a clatter leaving, both in the way she closed the curtain and the way she shut the door. I&#039;m sure she&#039;s a very nice person, I&#039;m sure she needs to learn, but someone needs to think this through a little better. She doesn&#039;t need to learn more than my person needs to sleep.</p><p>My solution was to ask the nurse to put a note on the door saying simply: &quot;Patient sleeping. Do not disturb.&quot; I removed it promptly when my person woke up.</p><p>&#160;&#160;</p><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While he has not used the word, President Obama&#039;s very first act, even before being sworn in, was to <em>reorganize</em>. As Jessica said <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/01/the-day-after-whos-responsible-for-what.html">yesterday</a>, at the stroke of noon, January 20, 2008, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House website</a> changed, and with it
a new, reorganized <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/">Executive Office of the
President</a> went into effect. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Having kept a close eye on the various Executive
Branch charts over the past few months, I can now report on the major
changes as I perceive them, including promotions,
additions, and deletions to the president’s core staff structure. These reorganizations reflect profound changes in emphasis and
priorities, adaptations to the external environment (literally), and a respect
for the complexity of the job. All of this comes through in a number of new functions focused
directly on the importance of <em>organization</em> itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Until today, our <a href="http://www.netage.com/economics/publish/USGov.html">digital US Government organization chart</a> used the Executive Office/White House structure of
the Bush Administration as its basis. Each time, Pres-elect Obama made appointments
and nominations, we entered those new names into existing positions, as we did when Larry
Summers was named director of the National Economic Council. When a new position, such
as Carol Browner’s remit to connect energy and climate, we engaged in some guesswork, trying to figure out how these new posts would hook together. Now we know.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010536e4dcf9970b-pi" style="display: block"><img alt="EOP_22Jan09" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010536e4dcf9970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mt_imported_image_1757842304.jpg" style="margin: 4px" title="EOP_22Jan09" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Obama&#039;s first appointment was Rahm Emanuel as Chief
of Staff to the President, who now runs the Executive Office. From what we can tell, Emanuel has
19 people reporting directly to him--ranging from
senior advisors such as David
Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett to James Jones, Director of the National
Security
Council. One of those 19 positions is that of the &quot;White House Office&quot; itself, which, in turn, is run, we think, by one
of two Deputy
Chiefs of Staff, either Mona Sutphen or Jim Messina. (This use of dual
deputies is already a
departure from the apparent Bush rule of one deputy.) While we can&#039;t quite determine yet whether Sutphen or Messina has this job, one of the two deputies has 23 people on staff, comprising a second group of advisors,
offices, and councils that are two steps below the root of power.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Both the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief
of Staff, with 19 and 23 direct reports respectively, are what we call “hub” positions in the US government, which we discuss
extensively in our <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/whpapers/NAReports/NARpt02-analysis.html">report</a>
and blog <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/01/netage-reports-2-analyzing-the-organization-as-a-network.html">post</a>
on “Analyzing the Organization as a Network.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, five organizations have been &quot;promoted,&quot; their org-chart boxes having been moved up a level in the White House Office:</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>Domestic Policy Council (Melody Barnes);</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>National Economic Council (Summers);</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>Office of National AIDS Policy;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board; and</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>White House Military Office.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then there are nine new boxes representing official
functions that simply were not there before:</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal"></span></span></span>Chief of Staff&#039;s Office;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy
(Browner);</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>Office of Management and Administration;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>Oval Office Operations;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>Office of Presidential Personnel;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal"></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">
</span></span></span>Office of Urban Affairs Policy;</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>Office of Social Innovation (!); and </p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span></span>A splitting of the position of Advance and Appointments into two
functions</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And two organizations have been eliminated:</p>
<p class="BulletedNotBold"><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives;
and</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol"><span>·<span style="font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: normal;font-size: 7pt;line-height: normal">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</span></span></span>USA Freedom Corps.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Missing from the list (so far as I can tell) and unaccounted for is the announced, and highly
unusual, Office for Health Care Reform and its Director, Health and Human
Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Daschle.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Based on press releases from the Obama-Biden change.gov site and the newer, but not
complete, list of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing_room/nominations_and_appointments/">Nominations
&amp; Appointments</a> on the whitehouse.gov site, we&#039;ve been able to map about 50 positions in the Executive Office of the President. This means that we&#039;ve got about half of them as press accounts of the
President’s January 21 briefing for his staff, (the one announcing a pay freeze and emphasizing transparency), indicate that the staff as a whole numbers around 100.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To carry transparency the next step and to set a good example for other government departments and agencies to follow, we believe that President Obama
should immediately publish the org chart of his office. In our view, such a chart should include names
and responsibilities, indicating where jobs have been filled and where there are empty spots still awaiting appointments. Although all the departments publish org charts
(you can see these <a href="http://www.netage.com/economics/index-govcharts.html">charts </a>on our
site), the Bush White House&#039;s chart never went deeper than the two-level structure we
just discussed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">--Jeff Stamps</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica, even I have received these over the years.  Seems the post mark was from Utah, so my first inclination was somebody from my Alma Mater (BYU).  But over time I convinced myself it was just marketing.  Clever though don't you think?  I mean it managed to get all of us talking about!</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've been hanging out at the collaboration bar for a bit of time now, which means that we've seen a few different customers take stools, saying *theirs* is the only drink to order. They down a few and poof! they're gone.</p>
<p>Some have stuck. For at least a decade and a half, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">communities of practice</a> have held their seat. Ever since <a href="http://www.ewenger.com/">Etienne Wenger</a> (hello, old friend) coined the phrase in his and Jean Lave's 1991 book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Situated-Learning-Participation-Computational-Perspectives/dp/0521423740">Situated Learning</a></em>, savvy organizations have been promoting their use. Among the first was <a href="http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/bob-buckman">Bob Buckman</a>, then CEO of <a href="http://www.buckman.com/">Buckman Labs</a>, the specialty chemical company, who turned his entire organization into one gigantic global community of practice years before most reading here even had email accounts. We documented Bob's story in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Teams-Working-Boundaries-Technology/dp/0471388254">Virtual Teams</a></em>--and, perhaps more importantly, he documented it himself in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Knowledge-Driven-Organization-Robert-Buckman/dp/0071384715">Building the Knowledge-Driven Organization</a></em>.</p>
<p>Not long after people in the collaboration community (which will have to be a subject of another post someday) started to use the term &quot;communities of practice&quot; came its partner-in-crime, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management">knowledge management</a>, whose history <a href="http://www.sveiby.com/Portals/0/articles/IntellectualCapital.html">Karl-Erik Sveiby</a>, the Swedish writer and consultant, has been tracking for years.</p>
<p>Comes then a whole sector of the tech industry focused on making it easier for people to &quot;manage&quot; their knowledge, a concept that bears reflecting upon elsewhere (is knowledge manageable as, say, people are? - I'll let that one go for now). Also comes then all manner of upstart efforts within organizations to swap learning as fast as possible, often without their employers' imprimaturs.</p>
<p>Among these were two majors in the US Army, Nate Allen and Tony Burgess, who, without sanction or budget or business plan, started <a href="http://companycommand.army.mil/">Companycommand.com</a>. There soldiers could exchange, well, war stories. A good summary of their experience is documented in the Government Executive article, &quot;<a href="http://www.govexec.com/features/0705-15/0705-15admt2.htm">Managing Technology Linked in the Fight</a>,&quot; which was laid out in detail in the 2005 book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/CompanyCommand-Unleashing-Power-Army-Profession/dp/0976454106">CompanyCommand: Unleashing the Power of the Army Professional</a></em>, which the two majors along with two others co-authored with <a href="http://www.commonknowledge.org/page.asp?id=29">Professor Nancy Dixon</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is a windy introduction to the fact that the US Army has a long, rich history in communities of practice with now probably tens of thousands of online forums where soldiers of every rank can exchange information in a timely way.</p>
<p>So it was that the Army held its 3rd Annual <a href="http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/bcks/index.asp">Knowledge Management Conference</a> last week, where we, along with Dr. Dixon and others, gave talks, ours titled <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/events/ArmyKMConf_Nov07.pdf">The Transformational Power of Networks, Teamnets and Virtual Teams</a>. Lots of discussion about communities of practice, knowledge sharing, semantic webs, and all the other topics that IT professionals, learning experts, and the top brass, whether those with stars on their shoulders or big paychecks, worry about.</p>
<p>OK. What's next? Jeff and I came away thinking about this: perhaps the era of the community of practice needs to morph a bit. Aren't we now in the time when teams, not just amorphous communities or lone-ranger individuals, need to share practices? And isn't the technology up to the task, what with virtual (or, if you prefer, global) teams exploding everywhere and wikis for teams going up on the web faster than their IT departments can track them? Teams, we think, are the way to work (without diminishing the genius and creativity of the individual), the hope for solving the seemingly intractable problems that sometimes make it hard to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>Thus, we invite a new customer to the collaboration bar: <strong>Teams of Practice, </strong>the title of this post.</p>

The theme of teams is so broad, deep and significant that it will take collective genius (practical and theoretical) to plumb all its implications. However, it takes facilitative genius like yours to catalyze and focus the conversation. An MOE is a measure of effectiveness (I should have put MOE in parentheses right after I first used the term).  For example, the team customer would surely provide the measure of effectiveness for the team product or service, and probably for team capability.  The role of technology-enabled teams in leader development, knowledge creation, decision-making, innovation and learning is critical to both competitive advantage and cooperative effects. Working through this role has to be high up on the agenda of any organization that adapts an aggressive knowledge strategy, faces intense competition, or alternately has to build collaborative capability across organizational and cultural divides.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Joe Koskey <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— November 13, 2007 at 10:16 AM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">I too am inclined to agree that we are at a nexus where the shift from individual to team practices can occur.

And, Joe, you're welcome to make noise too (thanks for <em>your</em> nice words) ... and ... good question about what gets measured. We've come across a ton of proposals around this over the years that all revolve around performance reviews - contribution to the organization's goals, contribution to team's goals, contributions to own goals, etc. But good as that is, methinks there's more to it as together we do things that we can't do alone, qualitatively different things. Need to keep chewing on this.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Mike Gotta <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— November 20, 2007 at 12:31 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Jessica, An interesting concept. I typically have drawn a distinction between co-located teams, virtual teams and far-flung teams as well as between communities of interest and communities of practice. This idea of networks between team entities seems like a natural dynamic to acknowledge.
Some clarifing questions:
- are you saying a team itself is a team of practice or are you saying that teams (as an entity) connecting to other teams form team nets and thus, teams of practice
- Are all teams defacto teams of practice (how does one become a team of practice)?
- when are teams of practice <em>not</em> a community of one sort or another. Are team nets merely a transitory step towards a community or are they fixed and do not coalesce (in which case are these group clusters within a broader social network)?
Good brain food  and right before Thanksgiving...</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">jessica lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— November 20, 2007 at 01:20 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Thanks for the thoughtful comment, Mike.

We served as mentors for <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leading-Virtual-Teams-Pocket-Mentor/dp/1422128865" target="_self">Leading Virtual Teams</a></em>, which meant writing the intro and reading carefully for content, adding bits of material here and there. Since we didn&#039;t write it, I can praise it. Good, with all the fundamentals. Readable in an hour or so and excellent for stimulating conversation in a virtual team.</p>

<p>Bryan Marquard&#039;s sensitive and insightful obit (&quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/08/01/daja_meston_39_buddhist_peace_hid_his_inner_struggles/" target="_self">Daja Meston: Buddhist peace hid his inner struggles</a>&quot;) in today&#039;s Boston Globe for our dear friend, Wangchuk. I&#039;ve <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/comes_the_peace.html" target="_self">written</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2008/02/very-good-karma.html" target="_self">about</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2007/11/giving.html" target="_self">him and his wife Phuni</a> a number of times before here, never expecting what has happened. Wangchuk, who struggled with depression, took his own life on July 11.</p>
<p>Phuni, along with their friends Robert Barnett, head of the Contemporary Tibetan Studies Program at Columbia University, and Patrick Curley, an attorney here in Boston, speak beautifully about Wangchuk in the obit. Please read it.</p>
<p>Today friends and family will gather for his memorial service at 3 PM at 10 Twin Pond Lane, Lincoln, MA.</p>
<p>We are all so very sad.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is in the news and it&#039;s not the first time he&#039;s been center stage.</em></p>
<p><em>Students of the Iraq War may recall that <em>at the start of the war,&#160;</em>Shinseki, a four-star general, was the Chief of Staff of the Army who got into a public row with then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over troop strength. Shinseki said the US needed on the order of 250,000 troops in Iraq once the war wound down. In a clear rebuke, Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz made it known that they disagreed and Shinseki was forced out of his post.</em></p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Shinseki&#039;s view was vindicated and supported across the aisle and in The White House.</em></p>
<p><em>It was precisely when this was happening in the spring of 2003 that <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/jeff-stamps/" target="_self">Jeff Stamps</a> and I came into contact with General Shinseki, something we neither planned nor ever imagined. We pulled that story together for an unpublished book, &quot;Leading Networks,&quot; and, given Shinseki&#039;s prominence at the moment, I think it&#039;s worth retelling here</em>.</p>

<p>On February 10, 2003, I answered the phone and found an unlikely caller. &quot;I&#039;m calling on behalf of (then-) Major General Jim Dubik,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#039;d like you to come to a wargame.&quot;</p>
<p>Unified Quest 03, the aide explained, would be the first Joint Forces-US Army Wargame, a weeklong simulation that would take place at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We would be among a small group of outsiders; the other 700 people would be from military forces both in the U.S. and among American allies and from defense contracting firms.</p>
<p>I said that I&#039;d never heard of General Dubik. &quot;Well, he’s heard of you&quot;, the aide replied, explaining that Dubik had read and been interested in <em>The Age of the Network,</em> a book we’d written ten years earlier.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841021.jpg"><img alt="Dubik" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401a73dc89a8d970d img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841019.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Dubik" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Lt. Gen. Jim Dubik, now retired, photo from <a href="https://law.psu.edu/news/dubik_accepts_bradley_chair" target="_self">Penn State Dickinson School of Law site</a>,</em><br /><em>where he holds the&#160;Gen. Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership</em></p>
<p>Jeff was as flabbergasted as I when I went into his study to tell him.</p>
<p>We had met as anti-Vietnam War activists in 1968 while students at Oxford University.</p>
<p>In contrast to some of our friends in 2003 who argued with us, we strongly opposed the then-looming Iraq War.</p>
<p>We decided to attend.</p>
<p>And then we told our friends what we were planning to do. Invariably we got the same reply: “You’re going to be doing <em>what</em>?” Then quickly, nearly all followed with, “Thank God. I’m so glad you’re going.”</p>
<p>Thus began our involvement with the American military, particularly the Army, where we’ve discovered that some of its ideas, particularly in regard to leadership, are ahead of those we&#039;ve encountered as consultants in the commercial and non-profit sectors.</p>
<p>To attend a wargame was beyond our ken. So it was with apprehension, curiosity, and a little discomfort that we went to the Carlisle Barracks, reflected in a summary I wrote after the event:</p>
<p>&quot;My coming-in-picture of a &#039;wargame?&#039; I thought it would be fought in a space the size of at least a basketball court, maybe even as large as the hangar I once toured at Douglas Aircraft where the MD-11 was being built.</p>
<p>&quot;And, I wasn’t sure precisely what would transpire on this &#039;battlefield.&#039; I thought it was unlikely that we&#039;d find people playing laser tag or paintball, but I wasn’t even certain of that. I was unprepared for the wargame to be &#039;fought&#039; in crowded conference rooms, where it was hard to hear what people were saying and where the commander’s back was usually turned toward most of those in the room.&quot;</p>
<p>The wargame&#160;that (now-retired Lieutenant General) Dubik invited us to—in this case, a thinly disguised confrontation with a country called “Nair” (unscramble the letters)—included our attending the daily debriefings for the&#160;“flag officer” (read highest-ranking officers) at the end of each day. There, the senior military strategists, many retired, would deconstruct the day’s wargame results.</p>
<p>Following the opening session at the War College’s Bliss Hall, which I remember as being very loud and filled with promotional videos for various weapons and tanks, Bill Rittenhouse, then a career staffer for the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command and an organizer of the event, found us stumbling around, unsure of what to do next or where to go. He welcomed us, indicating that he wasn’t quite certain what we were supposed to be doing either, but immediately introduced us to Clint Ancker, a retired colonel doing research on the Army’s structure and director of the famed Center for Army Lessons Learned.</p>
<p>We knew who Ancker was because one of his aides had been corresponding with us over the prior few months on “echelonment.” The word, from the French, literally means rungs on a ladder, and is the term the military uses to describe its levels of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Ancker and his group had been tasked with responding to a “request” from the then-Secretary of Defense. Now that the forces were “joint,” meaning that they all had to play nice together, Rumsfeld wanted the Army to remove a level, an echelon, from its traditional command structure, a rung near the top. Over lunch, Ancker drew some pictures about options for the Army’s reorganization, which reassured us that our expertise in networks had some relevance to what they were working on.</p>
<p>From that informative lunch, Ancker moved us along to meet then-Brigadier General (later Lieutenant General) Mike Vane, a self-described California beach boy in his youth, and one of the conference co-chairs.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841021-1.jpg"><img alt="Vane" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401a3fd0dbd3e970b img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841019-1.jpg" style="width: 250px;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Vane" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Lieutenant General Mike Vane, now retired, photo from <a href="http://www.army.mil/article/48544/strengthening-ties-between-army-capabilities-engineering/" target="_self">US Army site</a></p>
<p>Vane, in turn, took us into a small room to wait for General Dubik. “Hi, I’m Jim Dubik,” said the informally dressed general, extending his hand as he walked in.</p>
<p>After the usual pleasantries, we asked the central questions: “Why are we here and what do you want us to do?” Dubik responded in a way that we’ve become accustomed to in working with senior executives.</p>
<p>“I don’t know precisely,” he said. “I read your book about networks. We’re fighting a networked enemy. We have a net-centric warfare strategy in place. And we’re responding to the SecDef’s request for material on echelonment.”</p>
<p>Dubik told us to “wander around” and to try to absorb as much as we could as quickly as possible, and to reflect back what we noticed. He asked that we pay attention to “jointness” (how the separate forces worked together) and “echelonment,” in particular, but cautioned us not to artificially limit our scope.</p>
<p>These intriguingly broad terms of reference allowed us to follow an unscripted flow. After a tour of the wargame premises by one of Vane’s aides, we were, for the most part, left on our own.</p>
<p>Over the following week, we talked with dozens of people both formally and informally. We sat in on sessions where specific maneuvers were debated in snatches and at length. We shared meals with generals and admirals, trading health tips and nutrition theories with a four-star. We exchanged references with analysts, media, and advisors.</p>
<p>And, we attended the highest-level meeting of our lives, an “out-brief,” military-speak for what business refers to as a post-mortem, with the Joint Chiefs.</p>
<p>On the last day of the wargame, General Shinseki arrived to hear the conclusions of the exercises. It was one of the rare events that we weren&#039;t invited to but when it was over, the ground crew involved with putting on the event—the schleppers, the logistics people, and the sponsoring senior military officers, including Dubik and Vane—stood in a line as Shinseki spoke to them, thanking each individually.</p>
<p>Everyone knew what was happening—indeed, Shinseki&#039;s disagreement with the Bush administration over troop strength required in Iraq, an estimate that later proved to be entirely accurate, had been broadcast on television—and sadness seeped across the floor just beneath the evident respect that seemed to pour from people&#039;s eyes. Shinseki then walked down the line, pressing a medal commemorating the wargame into the hand of each person who&#039;d worked the event. After the meet-and-greet, Dubik pressed one into each of our hands.</p>
<p>The next day, we drove south from Carlisle to Fort McNair in Washington for the “Senior Leaders Seminar,” the last event of this historic wargame. There, the generals and admirals who orchestrated the wargame, along with a handful of participants from the Carlisle exercises, met with the military&#039;s top brass, including the Chief of Naval Operations, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Supreme Allied Commander of Atlantic, along with their peers—as well as the then-Deputy Secretary of Defense, Wolfowitz. Of the ninety guests, as best we could determine we were the only true civilians, and I was the only woman. We were seated just behind Wolfowitz and the Army Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>This gathering at the National Defense University took place the very day after then-President Bush landed on the USS Lincoln to proclaim “Mission Accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>General Shinseki led the proceedings. Seated to his left was Wolfowitz, who arrived late and left barely ten minutes later, just moments after the briefing began. (An aide came in, handed him a note, and he said that he had to leave because &quot;the Secretary needs me.&quot;)</p>
<p>Surely Wolfowitz could not have wanted to hear the words of one retired four-star Air Force general who said plainly, “Preemption does not work.” Preemption, the Bush administration policy employed in the Iraq War, the general said, violated the principles of war, left the enemy no choice but to respond with unconventional methods (meaning weapons of mass destruction), and placed the preempting forces without any of their conventional means of applying pressure incrementally.</p>
<p>This “After Action Review,” the systematic method the Army developed for reviewing its “actions,” included a ten-minute video positioning the history and chronology of this particular wargame, emerging issues identified by the wargame teams, and feedback from those participating.</p>
<p>We were told that this meeting was historic: It was the first time the highest levels of US military had convened as a network of peers for a wargame debriefing. Hot on the heels of the initial and what then appeared to have been the stunningly successful invasion of Iraq—reportedly the most &quot;joint&quot; operation in history—was “a not-to-be-missed opportunity,” which is how Admiral Vern Clark, then the Chief Naval Officer, described it to us as we were leaving.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted for a few hours; our involvement with the military lasted for another five years until the last of the crop of senior officers whom we knew retired.</p>
<p>What we took away was that while the “joint” approach to military affairs as practiced at this wargame is still being worked out, it is evident that the complexity of global relations in the 21st century demands it.</p>
<p>The immediate, mind-boggling dilemma of security in a pre-emptive, time-warped world with unpredictable enemies who have access to unthinkable weapons no longer allows individual and separate hierarchies to march forward.</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Hi Jessica,
This is great stuff.
There is an FM (field manual) for the After Action Review.
Network warfare is discussed in the RAND papers called In Athens's Camp (Chapter 19 starting on page 455).
The learning required to move to action under chaos is critical. Burt Maggart MG (RET) has an obscure paper that sets out a framework for situational awareness and leadership that is really helpful.
Best regards,
Hal</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark your calendars, Margaret Fuller fanatics, itinerant Transcendentalists, and anyone else looking for a good time on Saturday, May 23.</p><p>A group of us who admire and honor the work, life, and legacy of
Margaret have come together to plan for the bicentennial of her birth,
which takes place next May 23, 2010.</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d0883401156f70bf7a970c-pi"><img alt="Margaret reading" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401156f70bf7a970c " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/mt_imported_image_1757842208.jpg" style="margin: 5px" title="Margaret reading" /></a></p><p>We&#039;re seizing the moment of her 199th birthday to kick off the festivities. Please join us at 5 PM, May 23 (drilling in the date) at First Parish, 3 Church Street, Cambridge, MA, right in the heart of Harvard Square for a reception, featuring a stellar crowd, including:</p><ul>
<li>“Margaret Fuller” (aka <a href="http://www.gis.net/%7Emtf/jessa.html">Jessa Piaia</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lauriejames.net/">Laurie James</a> (actor, author, Bicentennial Committee—New York area)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emerson.edu/writing_lit_publishing/faculty.cfm?facultyID=2513">Megan Marshall</a> (author, historian)</li>
<li>Judith Strong Albert (independent scholar, American Literature Association)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jacquelineschwab.com/">Jacqueline Schwab</a> (pianist, historical documentaries by PBS filmmaker Ken Burns)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.rainbowsolutions.us/about_us/about_us_index.html">Dorothy Emerson</a> (Unitarian Universalist minister, Bicentennial Comm—New England)</li>
</ul>
<p>Proceeds from the event benefit the Margaret Fuller Bicentennial and will be matched by the Fund for Unitarian Universalism ($25 donation, light refreshments, great people). It&#039;s our good fortune that the reception coincides with the <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/english/ala2/american_literature_association_2009.htm">American Literature Association&#039;s annual conference</a> here in Boston, where two panels about Margaret will take place.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Really? According to Bombay's <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/aboutus.php?leftnm=11">Business Standard</a>, &quot;'<a href="http://www.business-standard.com/common/news_article.php?chkFlg=&amp;subLeft=0&amp;leftnm=8&amp;autono=321701">Obsolete tools' like e-mail and instant messengers</a> could act as roadblocks for the growth of web collaboration, say experts.&quot; Experts cited in this article come from some technology companies purveying different gadgets for getting along online so reader beware. Still, this notion that <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/email-is-for-ol.html">email is on its way out</a> (first time I've heard it applied to IM, though) continues to pop up in odd places...not including <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/04/email-friend-or.html">the enthusiastic email defender</a> I recently encountered in a workshop.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Mehegan, who writes features on authors for The Boston Globe, has a heartening piece about a first-time novelist whose book is on the best-seller list. &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/07/16/best_seller_out_of_the_blue/">Best seller out of the blue</a>&quot; is the story of David Wroblewski, whose book, <em>The Epic of Edgar Sawtelle</em>, has taken off. Improbable, yes, but at a time when everyone is whining about it being next to impossible to publish, no less, sell books, this is a very good story. Thanks, again, David, for another great piece of work.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#039;s an interesting subtext arising from Yahoo&#039;s having selected a woman in her third-trimester (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/marissa-mayer-pregnant_n_1682204.html" target="_self">Marissa Mayer, whose first child, a son, is due in October</a>) as its new CEO.

The article is based on research conducted by Susanne Bruckmüller at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and Nyla R. Branscombe at the University of Kansas. The term that it named has suddenly become common parlance: glass cliffs. I will explain...</p>
<p>But before we get to that, this morning&#039;s news about Mayer&#039;s selection: &quot;&#039;My maternity leave will be a few weeks long and I&#039;ll <a href="http://lifeinc.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/17/12790329-new-yahoo-ceo-says-shell-work-through-maternity-leave?lite#" id="itxthook0" rel="nofollow" style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;padding-bottom: 1px;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent">work</a> throughout it,&#039; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" target="_self">Mayer</a> said,&quot; as reported widely, including on MSNBC.</p>
<p>OK. Unlike most working mothers -- and as many have quickly pointed out, Mayer has the resources to hire a staff to manage home, baby, work, and all that comes with being a human mother in a super-tech society. If she&#039;s nursing, someone can hand her the baby and then take him away for burping, changing, and rocking to sleep. If she wants to pump, a Silicon Valley friend is surely to have the most high-tech equipment that she can lend her -- or, as an engineer, she&#039;ll invent a new one herself. If she needs to be &quot;present&quot; for a meeting, her company can provide super hi-def video conferencing. If she needs to attend a meeting in person (how quaint), a driver can be waiting on either end, eliminating the extra effort required to think about whether she might have a dead battery caused by having failed to close the car door properly after hauling out the car seat with sleeping baby, the diaper bag, her laptop, her briefcase, and the pile of papers that she just threw on the seat next to her, not to mention having to think through how close she can park -- or how late the train will be, thus cutting a few minutes off the commute. Laundry? Someone else can be responsible for the endless loads that babies bring with them. Meals? Trips to the dry cleaner because the baby is guaranteed to spit up right after she&#039;s gotten dressed? Need I be more explicit?</p>
<p>Don&#039;t misunderstand. I am thrilled that 37-year-old Mayer has been selected for the Yahoo post -- and I wish all new mothers a small army to help. Mayer&#039;s appointment signals another peak that&#039;s been summited in the glare of the cameras, er, bloggers. Being punished for providing another contribution to the continuation of the species is ... no words for the anger this evokes in those of us who&#039;ve been sidelined, penalized, and insulted for committing the crime of working while being pregnant or the mother of a newborn. And in the interest of self-relevation, I speak as someone who took five weeks off when my first child was born and took virtually no time off when my second was born (<a href="endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/jeff-stamps/" target="_self">we&#039;d</a> just signed <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/books/Networking/networking.html" target="_self">our first book contract</a>) -- but note that I was working in my own company and had the ability to do whatever I wanted. (Comment to former pregnant employees: I&#039;m proud that we were able to provide paid maternity leave; my only regret is that it couldn&#039;t have been longer.)</p>
<p>So that&#039;s a lot of what&#039;s roiling around in my and other minds about Mayer&#039;s appointment and announcement. But before I dismount the podium, I feel compelled to restate what I&#039;ve seen elsewhere and which was my very first thought: You just don&#039;t know how you&#039;re going to respond when your baby is born. As important as work seems beforehand, it pales in the face of the human being who will change your perception of just about everything. A meeting as compared with an embrace of that little person? Strategy in dealing with a pesky investor vs. the feeling of that tender skin against your cheek? Let&#039;s check in again on that in early November, Marissa. What you have to say about the experience of being a working mother has a major megaphone and your words will be well heard.</p>
<p>OK, back to Tom Stewart&#039;s prompt that got this post to happen. The article he references draws on a research experiment that looked at how people might choose leaders when situations are described in different terms. The result? The subjects chose women over men to lead in troubled situations. People recognize, it would appear, that turnarounds require good relationship skills more than they do sharpened <a href="http://www.pencils.com/pencil-history" target="_self">pencils</a> (implements that you may remember -- they have graphite in them, used to made of wood and painted yellow, many of us liked the #2s). The &quot;glass cliff&quot; comes in because when women are chosen for these posts: they&#039;re put in very precarious positions, ones on which it&#039;s very easy to loose one&#039;s footing. (Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Bartz" target="_self">Carol Bartz</a>, former CEO of Autodesk who tried and failed at Yahoo, reportedly ultimately being <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/carol-bartz-fired/" target="_self">fired over the phone by the Yahoo board chairman</a>?)</p>
<p>Now to the so-far unspoken but obvious subtext: isn&#039;t all good business about relationships rather than iron fists? About getting people to get along rather than telling underlings what to do? Aren&#039;t people in happy workplaces more likely to get things done than mean awful ones? Only our own prejudices stand in the way of hiring more women -- who, before I get this comment, are not the only ones with good relationship skills. I&#039;ve met my share of great CEOs who happen to be of the male persuasion, people who really know how to bring people together. The poor ones I&#039;ve met are precisely the opposite and fit the typical stereotype of the successful male CEO -- arrogant, head bashing, narcissistic, and often hypocritical. Just check the business page headlines (or should that be the white-collar crime report)? But that&#039;s another topic altogether.</p>
<p>--PS: I didn&#039;t realize when I wrote the title to this post that there&#039;s a website dedicated to <a href="http://www.feminismthreepointzero.com/" target="_self">Feminism 3.0</a>, and even one for <a href="http://feminism40.tumblr.com/" target="_self">Feminism 4.0</a>. Rather than just keep escalating, I&#039;m sticking with the old-fashioned 3.0.</p>

<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/08/first-printing.html">Ruth Nemzoff</a> reads from <em>Don't Bite Your Tongue</em> this coming Tues, 7:30 PM, August 19, at the Newton Free Library, here in our beloved hometown. (Ruth lives just a few miles from me here, or as some of us say, everyone lives in Newton.) Very nice portrait of Ruth today in The Boston Globe, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/08/17/parents_speak_up___at_right_time/">&quot;Parents, speak up - at right time</a>,&quot; by Susan Chaityn Lebovits. Having read it, I can attest that the book has good practical advice as per the article:</p><blockquote><p>Nemzoff said that she believes one of the most important factors in
maintaining a healthy relationship with adult children is forgiving
both yourself and your child for not being perfect. &quot;And the definition
of perfect changes daily,&quot; said Nemzoff. &quot;One day it could mean being
compassionate, and another day it could mean being high achieving with
conflicting desires, so there is no perfection.&quot;</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of a sudden, the webcams, used principally for family connections for years, are workhorses (so to speak). All of the meetings we&#039;ve had with Cisco of late have taken place in Webex, culminating in<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/06/trip-report-a-brief-foray-into-the-future.html"> the extravaganza last Tuesday</a> that combined Telepresence, Webex, and Cisco IPTV.</p><p>Then on Friday, for another client who shall go nameless but whose name you know, another webcast, this time via Adobe Connect, topic = &quot;Leading and Motivating Remote/Virtual Teams.&quot;</p><p>An increasingly familiar format: slides on the left of the screen, occupying about 50% of the layout, me in the upper right, then a pastiche of chat, presenter, and poll windows that popped up to survey the crowd, none of whom was co-located either.</p><p>The polls serve a useful purpose. For example, how many of you are multitasking, we asked? 100% responded 100%. (At least they were paying enough attention to respond, I quipped.) Feedback like this mid-presentation helps guide what to say next, much as it does in a face-to-face preso when you ask people to raise their hands.</p><p>At the same time, people were throwing questions into the chat box, a long list of which now await answering as there wasn&#039;t time to in the session to respond. Likewise, the questions help frame Part 2 of this webcast &quot;series.&quot; Last week&#039;s event centered around the most scarce of current resources, real-time interactions; the next centers around over-time communication.</p><p>Which brings up this last point, which really belongs in<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/06/trip-report-a-brief-foray-into-the-future.html"> yesterday&#039;s post</a>: If people are spread all around the world and the time difference spans 15 hours, where is the meeting taking place and what time is it? Online and cybertime are the obvious retorts but think about it. If our communication travels via packets, all split up into tiny digital bits, where is &quot;here,&quot; and if it&#039;s 6 AM for Amy, 9 AM for me, 2 PM for Jim, and 9 PM for Neil, what time is it &quot;now?&quot;</p><p></p>

Thus more than one post here about <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/04/my-love-affair-continues.html">Apple</a> and <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/04/hail-to-the-geniuses-again.html">the geniuses</a> behind the bar. I&#039;ve been addicted since the first Apple machine made its way into our house when our kids were little and, save a few years when incompatibility with client systems made its use secondary (those days are long in the past), I&#039;ve been a happy collector of a long stream of machines.</p><p>Almost problem free until that dreaded night in September when <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/09/apple-we-have-a-problem.html">my hard drive crashed</a>. Crashed is not sufficiently descriptive. Obliterated three years of work, email, addresses, articles, essays, books, photos...shall I continue?</p><p>Did I panic? No, not exactly. I had Time Machine, the &quot;infallible&quot; backup utility that works with Apple&#039;s newest operating system, Snow Leopard. It had been running for over a year, the little clock spinning counterclockwise (not sure this makes sense, ultimately, but never mind that). All I had to do was reunite with my backup drive (which I was separated from due to <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/lake-and-finn/">wonderful circumstances</a>).</p><p>My drive and I got back together shortly thereafter...and then the horrible reality emerged. Time Machine had not worked, not recorded anything, zippo, zero. I explained the glitch in detail in <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/09/apple-we-have-a-problem.html">this post</a>. Briefly, and horrifyingly, Time Machine doesn&#039;t** work when one&#039;s machine name has non-ASCII characters in it. Huh? Every machine has a name; in my case, the Apple salesperson assigned it when I bought this machine, calling it, brilliantly, &quot;Jessica Lipnack&#039;s MacBook Pro 15-inch.&quot; That would have two such offending characters in it - the &#039; and the -. Unfortunately, and contrary to what one would think about Apple&#039;s good user support, Time Machine does not issue a warning for this situation; in fact, it appears that the backup system is working, clock spinning and all.</p>I won&#039;t review the many hassles since - except to say that two months and counting, I&#039;m still trying to obtain fully usable files from the disk recovery company, Kroll OnTrack. They&#039;re trying, which I appreciate, but we&#039;re not there yet.<p>Apple, meanwhile, has done something quite remarkable. After many calls, escalations, hours on the help line, conversations with very senior technical people and people in customer service, I received a reimbursement from the company a couple of weeks ago. They&#039;ve asked me not to reveal the precise amount, which I, as a business person, am honoring. Every customer situation is different and I have to agree with them. From my perspective, mine is particularly awful: A 25-year customer and unpaid evangelist for the company experiences horrendous consequences from a malfunctioning product, incalculable, really, in terms of what has slipped away.</p><p>Where does this leave me? Convinced that Apple listens, that it, in this case, has honestly owned up to a mistake, and heard that there ultimately is no way to completely fix what happened to me and my files.</p><p>What to do going forward? Time Machine is up and running now that I&#039;ve changed my machine name; the little clock is spinning; I&#039;ve checked that the files are there (my bad, Apple, for not double checking instead of taking it for granted that spinning meant working); and I&#039;m waiting for the release of a Snow Leopard-compatible version of Carbonite, redundancy being the only remedy in the digital world.</p><p>Thanks, Apple. You done right by this woman.</p><p>**According to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1327">this note</a> on the Apple site, the problem was fixed in the 10.5.2 OSX update.</p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been voting in presidential elections since email was invented and, jeez, louise, I have never received so many forwards as this year. Is everyone else experiencing the same thing? This is the most emotional election I can recall, with friends and family who barely blink at such things, completely on fire. Even friends abroad are all up on things. True for you too?</p>

    <wp:comment_content>why is it good that obama is african american but palin is bad because of her gender? are her accomplishments politically less than obama's?  governor vs senator?
i'll grant that he has endured 19 months on the campaign trail and survived the best the Clinton's sling at him, which is reason enough to vote for him (so Hillary cant run in 4 more years).
the war is not unjust, its just a war, and those children are also adults who made choices to serve and obey their duly elected leaders, just like soldiers have done for centuries. its their dharma. the management of your retirement funds is your responsibility.
we need less emotion, not more emotion in the elecgtion. voting with the heart instead of the head is whywe always have such unappealing choices. its also pointless for me to vote in a state where one candidate has a 20% lead in the polls.</wp:comment_content>
