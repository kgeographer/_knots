  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need a new primary care physician (mine is leaving to go into &quot;international medicine&quot;). Leopard-spotted roses are more plentiful than PCPs, apparently. My search has been abetted by suggestions from friends who &quot;love&quot; their doctors (needless to say, all those physicians&#039; practices are closed), the high and mighty who control hospital systems and kindly have their assistants searching on my behalf, and friends who are MDs, who have excellent opinions about what I should do (thanks, K, for the terrific advice last night).</p><p>In the course of this search, I&#039;ve read a lot of doctors&#039; bios, which means I&#039;ve been to a lot of medical provider websites. More than once I&#039;ve run into the description of doctors with <a href="http://www2.massgeneral.org/mghwest/mghw_ourservices_adultpc.htm">&quot;preventative&quot; medicine</a> as their specialty.</p><p>No. It&#039;s <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preventative">preventive</a>. My mother, the English teacher, drilled this into me. But don&#039;t take it from me. Here&#039;s what Webster&#039;s says:</p><div class="sep_top shd_hdr" style="margin-left: 40px">
<div class="lunatext">
<p><strong>Preventative</strong></p>Pre*vent&quot;a*tive\, n. That which prevents;  -- incorrectly used instead of preventive.<br /><br />

  <title>Socially responsible healthcare consuming?</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boston Globe is looking into the dirty little secrets of the healthcare world around here in a two-part Spotlight series (&quot;<em><em>Spotlight Team members [are] Scott Allen, Marcella Bombardieri, Michael
Rezendes, and editor Thomas Farragher, as well as Liz Kowalczyk and
Jeffrey Krasner of the Globe staff. It was written by Allen and
Bombardieri.&quot;]</em></em></p><p><em><em></em></em>The first article, which ran a couple of days ago, &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/a_healthcare_system_badly_out_of_balance/">A healthcare system badly out of balance</a>,&quot; discloses that the same tests and procedures receive wildly different reimbursements from insurers depending on where they&#039;re done. Look and ye shall see:</p><div style="text-align: center"><br /><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010536038038970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="MRI chart" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010536038038970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842602.jpg" /></a>
<br /></div><p><br />So why am I posting this? Because I need an MRI. This is not an unusual situation for me - as previously revealed, I have <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/ms/">MS</a> and MRIs are one principal way of tracking whether more plaque is building up in the brain, which is, like plaque on your teeth, not a good thing. My wonderful, beloved, attentive (and suffering from the flu) neurologist promptly returned my call yesterday, listened to my symptoms, and said the expected, that I should subject myself to the impossible hammerjack procedure once again (painless yet intensely annoying, for those of you who haven&#039;t had it - and not for the claustrophobic, i.e. take the Valium, if they offer it).</p><p>Then I remembered the chart, where I had instantly gone to the column with the MRIs earlier this week. If I go to his hospital, it will cost my health insurer roughly twice what it would if I go to the hospital just across town. Both are excellent hospitals - though this series has lifted up another blind, i.e. in many regards, the less expensive hospitals have superior results. I don&#039;t know about MS or MRI comparisons so I won&#039;t comment. What I do now is that I have a truly superior relationship with my neurologist and that I&#039;ve been astonishingly healthy under his care, i.e. why tamper with something that works?</p><p>But...here&#039;s where the socially responsible reflex comes in. Can I in good conscience cost our overburdened healthcare system another half a thou to get the results of a pretty standard procedure? Now that the info is out there, it&#039;s really hard to know how to proceed. What would you do?</p>

I just don&#x27;t think this kind of consumer behavior is going to have a big impact in the short-term. Most people aren&#x27;t going to think this way. And by the time you educate them to think that way, they&#x27;ll recognize there are more effective ways to reduce health care costs and they&#x27;ll press for those.<br/>In fact, you can probably do more to impact the health care system in your professional capacity than as a consumer.<br/>Although, it would benefit us all if everyone was a better health care consumer.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Lilly <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— December 05, 2008 at 08:18 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">It is clearly a question of market pricing and asymmetric pricing that is changing with the publication of costs.  Once they become known, the hospitals can not exploit the ignorance of the patients.<br/>Other elements come into the decision-for instance, your hospital may offer immediate scan at the time it suits you while the other may be less flexible.  If it does not matter to you, go for the cheaper option, especially if your specialist has no problem with the source of data. In fact, you would be expanding his professional network by doing so  and lying ground for other patients to take the same option in the future.<br/>In short, my inclination would be to go to cheaper hospital, if nothing else, to show the one you normally use that people like you take action on new information.<br/>Glad to hear that treatment is working.  Look after yourself!<br/>Best from deep night in Virginia Water, UK<br/>Lilly</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Jessica Lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— December 05, 2008 at 09:47 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Thanks, Lilly. Take a look at the Globe article that prompted this post, referenced there. The hospitals don&#x27;t exactly set the prices; they have some position in the market that enables them to negotiate with the insurers. And one group dominates in the Boston market. In truth, all the hospitals in Boston are pretty darn good but the sweet deal that one group gets is irritating to the other good ones and rightfully so. We need your complexity thinking on solving this problem!</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I would get the care, specifically doctor and hospital/facility, that I think is in going to provide me the best health outcome.  To me that's the only consideration in my decision.
How much an insurance company is going to reimburse my health care providers is irrelevant.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>J,
You could have the MRI done at a cheaper facility and your doctor could easily get the results. I just don't think this kind of consumer behavior is going to have a big impact in the short-term. Most people aren't going to think this way. And by the time you educate them to think that way, they'll recognize there are more effective ways to reduce health care costs and they'll press for those.
In fact, you can probably do more to impact the health care system in your professional capacity than as a consumer.
Although, it would benefit us all if everyone was a better health care consumer.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>It is clearly a question of market pricing and asymmetric pricing that is changing with the publication of costs.  Once they become known, the hospitals can not exploit the ignorance of the patients.
Other elements come into the decision-for instance, your hospital may offer immediate scan at the time it suits you while the other may be less flexible.  If it does not matter to you, go for the cheaper option, especially if your specialist has no problem with the source of data. In fact, you would be expanding his professional network by doing so  and lying ground for other patients to take the same option in the future.
In short, my inclination would be to go to cheaper hospital, if nothing else, to show the one you normally use that people like you take action on new information.
Glad to hear that treatment is working.  Look after yourself!

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks, Lilly. Take a look at the Globe article that prompted this post, referenced there. The hospitals don't exactly set the prices; they have some position in the market that enables them to negotiate with the insurers. And one group dominates in the Boston market. In truth, all the hospitals in Boston are pretty darn good but the sweet deal that one group gets is irritating to the other good ones and rightfully so. We need your complexity thinking on solving this problem!</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Sun's good results from telecommuting</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ted Samson has an instructive and fact-filled report in InfoWorld on Sun's success in sending workers home, &quot;<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/sustainableit/archives/2008/06/telecommuting_s.html">Sun, employees find big savings from Open Work telecommuting program</a>.&quot; This is the emblem of the article I want to just steal and post here but alas, you must click. You MUST, it's that worth reading if you're in the ranks of those who make such decisions or in the ranks of those who'd like to see such decisions made. Thanks to <a href="http://stellacommute.blogspot.com/2008/06/i-havent-been-harping-on-eco-grooviness.html">Stella</a> for seeing this one first:</p><blockquote><p>Sun found that its U.S. employees worked at home an average of 2.1
days per week in 2007. In doing so, they saved an average of $870 per
year in gasoline (back when it was just $3.26 a gallon) and around
$1,770 dollars in wear and tear on their car (by driving 3,700 fewer
commute miles). They were also spared -- get this -- 104 hours of
commute time, which translates to around two and half weeks. This is
based on the finding that Sun U.S. employees have an average commute of
40 miles round-trip per day.</p>
<p>Presumably those savings make up for the fact that employees do need
to pay a negligible amount -- less than $20 per year, according to Sun
-- for the energy required to work from home, including heat.</p>
<p>Sun also found that employees used less energy at home than they do
at the office. &quot;Office equipment energy consumption rate at a Sun
office was two times that of home office equipment energy consumption,
from approximately 64 watts per hour at home to 130 watts per hour at a
Sun office.&quot; Contributing to the difference: Office employees tend to
use workstations and monitors while more home employees use laptops as
well as Sun Ray <strong><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/sustainableit/archives/2007/05/thinking_green.html">thin clients</a></strong>, both of which require less power than traditional desktop PC/monitor combos.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm speaking at &quot;KM 2.0 – Real or Hype?&quot; - the upcoming Boston KM Forum Symposium on Leveraging Knowledge at Bentley College.</p>
<p>Here's the abstract of my talk, &quot;Moving Beyond 2.0 Resistance:&quot;</p>
<p><em>Twenty years ago, an aspiring social network analyst asked us for the
names of everyone in our database. He had a program that could link
them up, he said, help them find one another, spark new connections.
How intrusive, I thought. Who’d want that? Years later, he would go on
to design one of the major social networking sites. I resisted and
resisted – and then something happened: someone I trusted explained
blogging to me, someone else invited me onto Facebook…and the rest is
what brings me to Boston KM Forum. This talk will be about resistance
to Web 2.0, even among people like myself who’ve been online forever,
and what happens when that resistance gives way to powerful experiences.</em></p>
<p>And here's the rundown of the other speakers and their topics:</p>
<p>* Mark Frydenberg, a Senior Lecturer at Bentley:&nbsp; Web 2.0 Tools for Knowledge Management</p>
<p>* Ray Sims, formerly Director of KM at Novell:&nbsp; KM and Web 2.0 – A User’s Perspective</p>
<p>* Dan Keldsen, Director of Market Intelligence at AIIM:&nbsp; Enterprise 2.0 = KM 2.0?</p>
<p>* Jeff Cram, Managing Director, and David Aponovich, Content Management Specialist, ISITE Design:&nbsp; Case Study:&nbsp; The Siemens BeFirst Portal</p>
<p>* Larry Chait, Chait and Associates:&nbsp; Wrap-up:&nbsp; KM 2.0 - Why We Should Care<br /></p>
<p>8:15-4:00 on Wednesday, April 9, 2008, Bentley College in Waltham, MA.&nbsp; The fee, including light breakfast and full lunch, is $50. </p>
<p>For more information and to register, go to the <a href="http://kmforum.org/blog/?p=47">Boston KM Forum site</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there…</p>

    <wp:comment_content>I guess I am suffering from too many connections and an inability to sort them... as you started your talk (which was great, btw) it began to sound very familiar and finally the light bulb went on and I realized I had read this on your blog!
Thanks again for a great talk, buy in and then acceptance/usage is so crucial on any KM project, especially when using collaborative 2.0 features... and sometimes we all need to be reminded just how painful and scary it can be to everyone else.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks, Amy. I'm considering trying to reconstruct my talk as I didn't make notes in advance. It's really gotten me thinking about why people and organizations resist change and what kinds of emotional alliances we can make that will help others bear the transition to the brave new world. Great to meet you!</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Hallelujah!  It has been driving me crazy, trying to reconstruct the trail of how I was led to your blog (because I was sure it wasn't directly via the KM Forum, I'm not that much of a space cadet).  It's BostonNow.  I am a committed T rider and read it most days and this blog is also posted there!</wp:comment_content>
