  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#039;s been thirteen days since I last posted, an unheard of interlude here. The reason is something we never imagined.</p><p>
<a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834013480ed52da970c-pi" style="float: left"><img alt="Jss 5:9:10" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834013480ed52da970c " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/mt_imported_image_1757841879.jpg" style="margin: 8px" title="Jss 5:9:10" /></a> <br /> On el Cinquo de Mayo, <a href="http://www.netage.com/About/JJprofile.html">Jeff Stamps</a>, my husband of 38 years, father of <a href="http://www.elizastamps.com/">my</a> <a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/aboutus/aboutus.html">children</a>, <a href="http://netage.com">business partner</a>, and my co-author of <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/index.html">six books and many articles</a>, went to the doctor. He&#039;d not been feeling well for several months but, being quite physically fit (he was a competitive downhill skier from the age of eleven, has always jogged, done tai chi, and more recently practiced yoga), he attributed his malaise to stress and overwork. The wife was not so sure but finally, nearly two weeks ago on a gorgeous Wednesday, he consented to visit his primary care physician.</p><p>Within harried hours came the diagnosis: <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=%7ENr_SSnTgUH5Uu">Stage 4 pancreatic cancer</a>.</p><p>By that evening, Jeff was admitted to the hospital for a simple procedure to relieve a blocked bile duct, which had caused severe jaundice. Meanwhile our children and grandchildren had arrived home and we found ourselves on a twisted path that was beyond our reckoning. In just this short time, there have been many turns already, most of them lined with gifts of friendship and love that lay hidden in the normal schedule of life.</p><p>We don&#039;t know how many difficulties face Jeff (and our family) going forward but we know they are considerable and we&#039;re clear about the conclusion and the vague time frame, which is mercilessly short.</p><p>And I don&#039;t know how much I&#039;ll be writing about this. My natural inclination is to use writing to stay sane and clear, which is what I&#039;ve done for my whole life (ok, since I was six and I wrote my first published article about a birthday party in my first-grade class). But this is different, as I&#039;m sure you can appreciate. And I&#039;m finding that I can&#039;t keep up with the many beautiful notes we&#039;ve gotten. So if you&#039;re prompted to write, please know that while I may not be able to respond, we are very grateful.</p><p>We are learning things we never knew about Jeff -- or perhaps better stated, things we knew but which didn&#039;t have the proper venue for expression. Like his huge capacity for grace when staring down his own death, his ability to let go of the things he holds most dear, and his untiring appetite for tackling complex ideas, which he continues to do even as he faces treatment to reduce symptoms. I would wish this kind of acceptance on anyone given the kind of death sentence he has. And I would hope that all families could find the way to do what our children have done, which is to join us, and find ways to continue their important work even as their father is dying.</p><p>We now are a three-generation household with our darling <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/lake-and-finn/">grandsons</a> providing the new background music. Watching them laughing their little heads off (they&#039;re eight months now) softens the jagged edges of this journey.</p><p>More, I&#039;m sure, as this unfolds.</p><p></p>

    <wp:comment_content>Ho boy.
I'm with you, sister. I've just been reviewing my CaringBridge journal, including the equally sudden discovery of my own disease.
I'll check in here for updates. Beaming love and support your way.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jeff and Jessica, we are all devastated by the news and will keep you and your family in our prayers. You have both been such an inspiration to us. Thank you for sharing your life and experiences. We here in Kansas (and Ohio) wish you both the best and are sending our love and hope.

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica and Jeff,
I don't know what brought me to the point of checking in on you today, but I did.
You brought me to New England, and I have now been here for 25 years. I've been too shy to stay in touch, over the years, and I'm deeply regretting it at this moment.
Jeff, you have been one of my intellectual heroes for the last quarter of a century. I will never forget the comprehensive, nuanced way you approach problems, and I'm sure you're approaching this one the same way.
Jessica, you've always been a rock, edges softened and rounded by deep currents.  Your soft strength is a blessing to Jeff, as it has been to us all.
Please know that I have never forgotten, and never will, and that I'm thinking of you...
Darrell</wp:comment_content>

I'm heartened by your comment of Jeff's grace. My own experience suggests this is and will be a great resource as time unfolds.

    <wp:comment_content>All comments seem trite compared to what I really want to write.
I will say a "mishaberach" (blessing for the ill) for Jeff in our old-world Lipnack way, oh the power of prayer.
Jules, 95 (!), moves into an assisted living apt. for no more reason than not having to move to FL each year away from the snow.
His energy and positive outlook amazes me daily. He just won an "award" for volunteering at the Home, him, who lost most of his world at age 17.
Daughter, Hillary's, gonna be a rabbi along with cantor, oh the debt of it all.
I wish I could be closer to give  hugs to your grandbabies. I'll work on that.
I'm glad you are able to focus and write about current (immoral) practices of BP and also glad I "found" you those many years ago.
Dad always talks of you with delight. You make us and others feel much less alone in our world.</wp:comment_content>

I'm sorry you're both facing this, although not surprised to see (and hear) you're both doing it with strength and grace. My best always.

    <wp:comment_content>How many wives should Abraham have had?
Once we solve this then maybe we can figure out why the Chinese emperor structured the court like it was.
Finally it might be possible to figure out this dilemma.
My question is "will BP exist next year?"
I am guessing the answer is no.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Marissa,</p>
<p>Apparently, I&#039;m not the only one who has a word or two to say to you. Tom Ashbrook (On Point, &quot;<a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/2013/02/27/yahoo-work" target="_self">Yahoos Ban on Working From Home</a>&quot;) is holding forth with some savvy guests even as I type; Maureen Dowd has a biting op-ed in yesterday&#039;s NY Times (&quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/opinion/dowd-get-off-your-cloud.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Get Off Of Your Cloud</a>&quot;); and the bloggers have gone wild. Not to mention that I&#039;ve received numerous emails including this one from a client: &quot;Wish you could write a counter to this and have it published.&#160; This does not help the cause...&quot;*</p>
<p>I regret that I&#039;ve had to <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/marissa-mayer" target="_self">make you a category here</a> but with so much emotion swirling around the HR edict ordering all-hands on the Yahoo! deck, let&#039;s begin with some facts:</p>
<p>1. As a computer scientist, you might want to look at real data. There is little evidence to support the notion that people need to be face-to-face to collaborate
OR innovate. Yes, there are moments to come together but not
perpetually. Professor Tom Allen set the lie to this idea 35 years ago with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Flow-Technology-Dissemination-Technological/dp/0262510278#reader_0262510278" target="_self">ground-breaking research</a> for Digital Equipment Corporation. Simply, if people are more than 50 meters (150 feet) apart, the &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Flow-Technology-Dissemination-Technological/dp/0262510278#reader_0262510278" target="_self">probability that two people will communicate [at least once a week] as a function of distance separating them</a>&quot; plummets. Here&#039;s the chart:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mt_imported_image_1757841121-1.jpg"><img alt="Allen chart" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834017ee8c46b7d970d" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mt_imported_image_1757841121.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Allen chart" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>2. &quot;<a href="http://hbr.org/product/can-absence-make-a-team-grow-stronger/an/R0405J-PDF-ENG" target="_self">Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger</a>?&quot; With two business school professors, we researched 54 high-performing teams in 26 companies across 15 industries and the resounding conclusion from the data was &quot;yes, indeed.&quot; Here&#039;s the quick summary from the Harvard Business Review where the study was published as &quot;Best Practices:&quot;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Some projects have such diverse requirements that they need a variety of
specialists to work on them. But often the best-qualified specialists
are scattered around the globe, perhaps at several companies.
Remarkably, an extensive benchmarking study reveals, it isn&#039;t necessary
to bring team members together to get their best work. In fact, they can
be even more productive if they stay separated and do all their
collaborating virtually.</p>
<p>The conclusion for Yahoo!: unless you&#039;re doing very simplistic projects, i.e. routine processing chores, stocking shelves, and the like, you&#039;re staffing your teams incorrectly. If you&#039;re looking for innovation, you need diversity, the subject of many studies before and after ours.There is no way that you have that diversity in toto within driving distance of your Silicon Valley. It&#039;s 2013, not 1950, the year the number of manufacturing workers reached its peak in the US.</p>
<p>3. Which leads right into this point. As per the title of this post, the genie is waaaay out of the bottle. Do you actually believe that people today work in intact teams? When you force
everyone to co-locate, you&#039;re most likely not bringing in the people who actually work together. Do you have contractors? Partners in other companies? Suppliers? Vendors? Developers in India/China/Philippines/Singapore? Do your sales people spend their time in the office? (If your answer to this one is yes, perhaps we&#039;ve pinpointed a big part of your problem.)</p>
<p>Unless Yahoo! has completely turned its back on development trends that are, say, as old as the Internet itself, team members are
scattered around the globe. Yahoo! should do a study of where its team
members are situated. We can place a pretty confident bet that they&#039;re not all in proximity of Yahoo! HQ.</p>
<p> And
that&#039;s just the start of what&#039;s wrong with this 20th century edict.</p>
<p>4. Let&#039;s talk about culture for a moment, one of the big points of the &quot;YAHOO! PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION--DO NOT FORWARD&quot; HR memo that <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/" target="_self">All Things D&#039;s Kara Swisher</a> had up within moments, it seems, and which has been published everywhere.</p>
<p>Forcing people into the office hardly builds loyalty. It&#039;s abundantly clear that Yahoo! is attempting a massive and quick turnaround of its culture. The insults about the workforce, as reflected in posts around the web, are legion. The parking lot is only half-full at 9:30 AM. Stopping right there, in some companies, this is regarded as a virtue, meaning that carpooling and the like are working, cutting down on carbon emissions. (For more on this, take a look at the pioneering climate initiative at <a href="http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/greenhousegases/" target="_self">Unilever</a>, which has coupled aggressive carbon reduction gains with <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2013/02/in-the-future-now-presenting-virtually.html" target="_self">new ways of working initiatives</a>, both increasing productivity and innovation and reducing travel miles.)</p>
<p>There are equally numerous reports on the new Google-esque perks at Yahoo! -- better food, dry cleaning services, nicer digs, for example. What builds culture is commitment, positive reinforcement, and challenging work. If you think people aren&#039;t coming into the office because they don&#039;t like the food, I strongly recommend that you commission a study on this.</p>
<p>Likewise, do you have evidence that people don&#039;t collaborate? That people truly are slacking off at home? Data in study after study indicates that people are more productive when they are able to get up, do whatever morning things they have to do at home (tend to kids/parents/animals/themselves) and then get right to work, saving needless hours on the highway. Hello? Aren&#039;t we talking about a bit of traffic on 101?</p>
<p>A most startling stat on this, &quot;The hard truth about telecommuting,&quot; from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Monthly Labor Review last June by Mary Noonan and Jennifer Glass and excerpted in the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=telecommuters-work-longer-hours-tha-12-12-26" target="_self">Dec 26 Scientific American</a>: telecommuters on average work 5-7 hours longer per week.</p>
<p>5. 24/7. After ordering people back to their cubbies, are you also <em>prohibiting</em> them from working at home? Consider what you&#039;re saying in the-now-much-quoted HR memo to Yahoos: &quot;To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. Some of the best decisions and insights comes from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and important impromptu meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo! and that starts with physically being together.&quot; OK, Yahoos. Turn off your phones at home; don&#039;t check your mail first thing in the morning (or last at night); and absolutely do not call from your cars. That applies to you, too, Marissa. Are you referring to your &quot;speed and quality&quot; when communicating from, as reported, your 14-day maternity leave?</p>
<p>6. I nearly can&#039;t bring myself to comment on this last point for which the young mother-CEO has been excoriated from GMT-12 to GMT+12. A few of your quotes are enraging to other parents, as you&#039;ve heard. Just this one will follow you for life: &quot;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-the-babys-been-way-easier-than-everyone-made-it-out-to-be-2012-11#ixzz2M7mE7uFi" target="_self">The baby&#039;s been easy. The baby&#039;s been way easier than everyone made it out to be</a>.&quot; I had &quot;easy&quot; babies too but I found it best to keep that under my hat. Most babies are not and it&#039;s quite hurtful to other women to rub it in, i.e. stuff a rag in that comment forevermore. And it&#039;s irking your coworkers that you have permission to build a nursery next to your office (even if you paid for it). When are you building sidecars for all the other new moms?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marissa, please invite in, say, 40 or 400 or 4000 of the mothers, not to mention the fathers, in your company and listen to what it&#039;s like to get through a day. I&#039;m watching a software executive who&#039;s your age with major responsibilities, as she is juggling young kids, big corporate decisions, a lot of travel, and being a good family member while her husband, although he doesn&#039;t travel as much, is also running on fumes as he works very long hours, cooks, and tells endless stories to the kids. And they can afford help.</p>
<p>There is something profoundly unglued, unrealistic, and uncompassionate in your new approach. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Teams-Working-Boundaries-Technology/dp/0471388254" target="_self">Virtual Teams</a></em> work -- I know. I wrote the book. Maybe you should read it.</p>

I work with colleagues all over the US and elsewhere remotely, and I cannot imagine what Marissa is talking about.  I&#x27;ve spent two hours on the horn today with people I&#x27;ve never met personally and a whole bunch of time in email interactions, and I&#x27;m not noticing any downfall in my productivity or creativity because of it. (Maybe I could use a bit more of both -tivities, but it&#x27;s not because of distance interaction!)  Seems to me that what people need is to really love their organizations, their work in those organizations and the capacity for self-regulation that comes from the development of attention and concentration.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">David Stephenson <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— February 27, 2013 at 07:45 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Boy, is she fighting a losing battle.

I think Marissa is right!.  I think she is making the correct and brave decision based on the current situation at hand, circumstances surrounding this under performing business and her strategic intent for Yahoo.  As you know I created one of the largest virtual workforce companies in the US, have always managed large groups of decentralized work teams and I am a firm believer in the virtual model--but I still believe in this situation, Marissa it right!<br/>I do not have first hand knowledge of the Yahoo environment and all my turnaround experience is with smaller organizations.  However, as an operator/manager/leader, you learn quickly that there is not a single model or method that works every time for any type of situation.  I fully understand and appreciate her challenges and desire to make a difference quickly and take control of her own destiny.  Considering that no effected employee likes or supports change, Yahoo has become comfortable being a 2nd-Tiered company, internally created innovation occurred at Yahoo in its first 5 years of existence and there has been little since then, the newly graduated technical employees like the social interaction of a cool work environment like that of Google, FaceBook, Rent the Runway, SurveyMonkey (many others), I support the Yahoo plan and hope that Marissa and the Board have the fortitude to carry it through.<br/>Eye-to-eye &amp;amp; heart-to-heart regular, repeated and on-going contact does make a difference with many turnaround, restart and rebuilding business situations.<br/>Thanks and good insights in your blog--BB</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Milton Chen <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— February 28, 2013 at 08:22 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Jessica, I love your science/fact filled article.

    <wp:comment_content>Thanks for this note, Jessica, with which I couldn't agree more.  I work with colleagues all over the US and elsewhere remotely, and I cannot imagine what Marissa is talking about.  I've spent two hours on the horn today with people I've never met personally and a whole bunch of time in email interactions, and I'm not noticing any downfall in my productivity or creativity because of it. (Maybe I could use a bit more of both -tivities, but it's not because of distance interaction!)  Seems to me that what people need is to really love their organizations, their work in those organizations and the capacity for self-regulation that comes from the development of attention and concentration.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Hi Jessica--
I enjoyed reading your blog and for many (maybe most) situations you are correct in your guidance, but I actually have a different perspective.  I think Marissa is right!.  I think she is making the correct and brave decision based on the current situation at hand, circumstances surrounding this under performing business and her strategic intent for Yahoo.  As you know I created one of the largest virtual workforce companies in the US, have always managed large groups of decentralized work teams and I am a firm believer in the virtual model--but I still believe in this situation, Marissa it right!
I do not have first hand knowledge of the Yahoo environment and all my turnaround experience is with smaller organizations.  However, as an operator/manager/leader, you learn quickly that there is not a single model or method that works every time for any type of situation.  I fully understand and appreciate her challenges and desire to make a difference quickly and take control of her own destiny.  Considering that no effected employee likes or supports change, Yahoo has become comfortable being a 2nd-Tiered company, internally created innovation occurred at Yahoo in its first 5 years of existence and there has been little since then, the newly graduated technical employees like the social interaction of a cool work environment like that of Google, FaceBook, Rent the Runway, SurveyMonkey (many others), I support the Yahoo plan and hope that Marissa and the Board have the fortitude to carry it through.
Eye-to-eye &amp;amp; heart-to-heart regular, repeated and on-going contact does make a difference with many turnaround, restart and rebuilding business situations.
Thanks and good insights in your blog--BB</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica, I love your science/fact filled article. As someone building a tool for creative teams to work remotely - I love hard data :) at vsee, we have been working remotely spread over 10 cities over the last 5 years - we came up with 3 golden rules that has helped our startup get things done: &lt;a href="http://vsee.com/blog/yahoo-no-remote-work-letter-marissa-mayer/" rel="nofollow ugc"&gt;http://vsee.com/blog/yahoo-no-remote-work-letter-marissa-mayer/&lt;/a&gt;</wp:comment_content>
