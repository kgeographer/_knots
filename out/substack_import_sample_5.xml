  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="Plane" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842595.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left">So with no need for further explanation, you get the picture. Traveling earlier this week for a quick one-day with a lovely client, two workshops back-to-back. Flight, despite its customary lack of room, very pleasant, including the incredible good luck of sitting next to a Microsoft exec who, after hearing my woes with Word, hands me a &quot;magic card&quot; (his words) marked &quot;Quick Assistance,&quot; which allowed me to call a Microsoft support line, be greeted by &quot;Kathy,&quot; who with some instructions, enabled me to trash a few troublesome files and presto! I can drag-and-drop text again. Thanks, Steve Resnick!<br /><br />OK, we land. Progress to the shuttle bus at this airport, which is approximately the size of Massachusetts, arrive at car rental. No hybrids, no Garmins. Off I go in a car that doesn&#039;t use a key. A terrible light goes on. One I&#039;ve never seen before. I pull over, search the glove compartment in hopes of looking up the light problem, but there&#039;s only a CD in it. A CD. I return to rental place. Attendant gives me the &quot;boy, are you stupid, lady&quot; routine, says it&#039;s, of course, as everyone knows, the tire pressure light, then says he&#039;ll feel the tires for me (no comment) and that I should just ignore it because the tires are just fine. Now it&#039;s getting dark and I&#039;m watching the time and I&#039;m about to be late for the dinner so I take off. (He was right, I am stupid.)<br /><br />This is a city, if you can call a metropolis the size of, say, Dallas-Fort Worth a city, with no lights on their road signs. Or signs with the number of miles to the next destination. And no match between the printed maps and the number of miles apparently ahead.<br /><br />This post is getting too long. A purported 45-minute journey takes two hours. The exit numbers don&#039;t match the printed exit numbers - as in I am supposed to get off at 465E but the numbers are like, Exit 81 and 82. I end up on a one-way street with no exit other than the Chuck-E Cheese (is that how you even spell it?) parking lot. My room key (key, ha!) at the hotel doesn&#039;t work. My breakfast doesn&#039;t come via room service (&quot;there was a problem with your order so we didn&#039;t know what to do&quot; - uh, er, call me?). I can&#039;t get the trunk of the car open (remember, only a CD in the glove compartment).<br /><br />Skip to the event, which is great. Very nice people, good thinkers, and a wonderful time is had by all.<br /><br />Then I&#039;m leaving and ask the locals for directions back to the airport. &quot;Take 35 East. No, take 35 West. I don&#039;t know. You can take 35 East or West.&quot; Finally, it&#039;s decided I should take 35 West. I do. No problem other than it&#039;s growing dark again and I can&#039;t see the road signs and there are no signs to the airport until 1.5 miles before I get there. Arrive in about an hour&#039;s time at airport. Pull into car rental and am asked about car. The light is still on so I explain what happened. &quot;Well, *that&#039;s* not the tire light,&quot; says the attendant. &quot;Who told you that? You never should have been put in this car.&quot; Result = $40 credit.<br /><br />Then I get on the shuttle bus back to the terminal.<br /><br />Wrong bus. Turns out there are three American terminals. Silly me.<br /><br />Skytrain to proper terminal.<br /><br />Grab a sandwich.<br /><br />Get on plane.<br /><br />Have whole row to myself.<br /><br />Ah, the enchanting life of the consultant.<br /></div></div>

The photos begin with this one taken June 17,
2005, showing Dr G leaving the Neshoba County Court House in Philadelphia, Miss., with David. She was there to testify in the murder trial of Ku Klux Klansman Edgar Ray
Killen, accused in the 1964 killings of her
son, Andy, and two other civil rights workers (Michael Schwerner and James Chaney). Then read <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070818/NEWS/708180350/1001/news">this obit</a> by Jerry Mitchell, who kept this story alive for a very long time. Read more <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/SPECIAL17/60416008">here</a> about Mitchell's tireless investigative reporting that &quot;<span class="art_p_body">has unearthed documents, cajoled suspects and
witnesses, and quietly pursued evidence in the nation's notorious
killings from the civil rights era.&quot;</span></p>
<p>At the trial, Dr. G read <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">the postcard</a> that Andy mailed from Mississippi on the day he was killed.</p>
<p>Killen was convicted of &quot;<span class="art_p_body">orchestrating the killings,&quot; Mitchell writes, </span><span class="art_p_body">on the 41st anniversary of the young men's murders June 21, 1964, </span><span class="art_p_body">and is serving sixty years in prison for manslaughter.<br /><br />Mitchell's personal understanding of Dr G comes through in his piece, reflected in the quote he chose from her son:</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="art_p_body">Goodman’s son, David, said today: “Besides
being my mother, my mentor and spiritual guide, she taught me the
precious value of human dignity and the importance of speaking up and
acting whenever your own, your family’s or other people’s dignities and
civil rights are denied.”</span></p></blockquote><p>Other obits: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/17/AR2007081702093.html">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6858818,00.html">The Guardian</a>...just google.</p>

  <title>Bourne Betrayal rises to #9 on NY Times list!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keen readers know of my recent meeting with <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/come-with-me-me.html">Eric Lustbader</a>, who is hands-down the biggest poster to this blog (grazie). Glory, glory. NY Times Book Review, tomorrow, July 15, 2007 does a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/15tbr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">nice call out</a> to his <em>Bourne Betrayal </em>and gives Eric the space to explain how he's writing books about Robert Ludlum's characters. Interesting writing proposition, Eric, and what a great gift from Mr. Ludlum's family. Open to answering a coupla questions here? Now, I've put you on the spot.</p>
<p>Antiochian alert: Eric went to grammar school with Neelon (nee Pepper) Crawford, '69, married to Susan Hill, '70.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span class="bold">THE BOURNE RESURGENCY:</span> Robert Ludlum died in
2001, but his books keep coming. The new one, “Robert Ludlum’s The
Bourne Betrayal,” written by Eric Van Lustbader, rises this week to No.
9 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/bestseller/0715besthardfiction.html">fiction list</a>.
Van Lustbader, who also publishes thrillers under his own (excellent)
name, took over the Bourne franchise a few years ago. On his <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/index.asp">Web site</a>,
he notes that some people “still seem confused by my writing novels
about a character created by Robert Ludlum.” For anyone who is still
puzzled, here’s Van Lustbader’s stab at <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/news.asp">clearing everything up</a>:
“I was asked by the estate of the late Robert Ludlum to continue the
series Bob started. He wrote three Bourne novels (‘The Bourne
Identity,’ ‘The Bourne Supremacy,’ ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’). ... I have
so far written ‘The Bourne Legacy’ and ‘The Bourne Betrayal.’ These
books are written entirely by me from my own ideas, though some people
persist in thinking that I wrote them with Bob. This would be rather
difficult to do, since he’s dead. Also, he left no notes or unfinished
manuscripts pertaining to Jason Bourne. Are we clear now? Good!”</p></blockquote>

    <wp:comment_content>Aiming for the reasonable, Eric, as the intelligent may be beyond my ken but here goes:
Q?
A: [as in ask yourself the first question - dirty pool :)]
Q: In Agatha Christie's obit (don't remember where), she was quoted as saying she really wanted to be a concert pianist, not a mystery writer. You?
Q: You said you don't hang with writers cuz they're too similar to you. Who then? What varities?
Q: How are you working OrgScope into your new novel? A character with an OrgScope in her pocket?</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>I always wanted to be in a rock'n'roll band.  I spent 10 years in rock doing many other things (writing, producing, A&amp;amp;R, publicity, merchandising).  I was even on stage with a couple of bands I went on the road with (Elton John, Mountain -- but that's another story)-- but that's as far as I got.
Anyway, strange to say, it's too public a life for me. My getting up in front of people constantly wpould surely lead to a mental breakdown!
Tomorrow, next question answered. Tune in. (This is the Charles Dickins version of a Blog).</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Q 3: the famous OrgScope.  I'm actually contemplating writing a XXX-rated short story with the OrgScope as my lead character.  He's a hard-boiled private dick in a near-future world similar to that of "Blade Runner."

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of us living in the Greater Boston Globe area learned yesterday that the most familiar of sounds, the morning paper tossed into the driveway (or dropped on the front step or brushing our apartment doors) may soon be permanently silenced.</p><p>Yesterday&#039;s banner headline so stunned me that I couldn&#039;t even compose a post: &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/04/times_co_threatens_to_shut_globe_seeks_20m_in_cuts_from_unions/">Times Co. threatens to shut Globe; seeks $20m in cuts from unions</a>.&quot; Later that day, The Times columnist <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimeskristof">Nicholas Kristof</a> posted this update to Twitter: &quot;<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Who would have ever, ever imagined that the Boston Globe might not survive? It&#039;s a grim time for a journalist.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, very grim. When the NY Times Company bought the Boston Globe back in 1993, some forward thinkers feared what was then perceived as the worst: that The Times management would turn the Globe into a regional paper.<br /><br />And indeed not many years passed before that proved mostly true (though there remains, almost against all odds, some fantastic &quot;Global&quot; reporting going on). Foreign bureaus were closed and the non-New England news seemed to increasingly bear the label of a news service, often The New York Times News Service.<br /><br />Another yes: all print media are suffering <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/you-wont-miss-it-til-its-gone-rocky-mountain-news.html">yadda</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/speaking-of-newspapers-c-1989.html">yadda</a>. But as <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/02/cancel-your-newspaper-subscription-april-2043-no-sooner.html">others</a> are <a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2009/04/reach-out-and-open-up-globe.html">saying</a>, a newspaper is not just a business. It&#039;s a way to keep a society honest through investigative reporting, informed through plain old good journalism, and together through speaking with an unmistakable voice.<br /><br />There are ways to solve this, New York Times Company, that fall outside the traditional means, axing everything in sight or demolishing the whole thing. We&#039;ve already lost many of our best Boston reporters.<br /><br />Thinking caps on, please. Fast. Yesterday&#039;s story gives the unions 30 days to make concessions. Make that 29 days. The response to yesterday&#039;s news is reflected in <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/05/threat_to_globe_triggers_flood_of_feelings/">an article today</a> and in the hundreds of comments on the Globe site itself.</span></span></p><p>A lot more than a newspaper is at stake.<br /><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"></span></span></p><p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"><br /></span></span></p>

    <wp:comment_content>So sad - certainly the newspaper industry is more worthy of a bailout than the banks and autos!</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>JBobb, I agree. 26 years is a long time to be in the news biz.
And, Jay, I agree that bailing out the newspaper industry might be a lot more worthy than banks and cars. Why hasn't anyone thought of that? Disposable, like the paper they're printed on???</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend is having problems being paid for services rendered to a nonprofit. Conclusion? Don&#039;t work for nonprofits, right?</p><p>In my experience, ta-da: wrong.</p><p>Having submitted invoices to many entities over the years -- everything from mega-corporations to city governments to tiny nonprofits -- the record holder for difficulty in being paid belongs to the big companies.</p><p>Back in the late 1980s, when Digital Equipment Corporation was the major employer in the cosmos (exaggeration, merely the universe), we were having problems being paid. So I decided to do a flow chart of the process. It took 19 separate signoffs. Other consultants started calling me for advice on how to be paid by DEC.</p><p>I guess that explains why Digital went out of business. Howevuh...while some companies are very efficient, I&#039;ve found it equally difficult with other big firms. The invoice submission process is a fine art (or really bad art) with ridiculous quirks that make slow nonprofits look like comets in comparison. The most ridiculous? Having to send paper copies of invoices -- you know, that stuff over in the pile in your paperless office -- to global enterprises. And then being told the paper copy, sent by overnight delivery service, was never received because Accounts Payable &quot;never heard of&quot; the person who signed for it in their Receiving Dept.</p><p>Meanwhile, I hope my friend is paid soon.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

Amy: Why is this different than for profits? I think the rule is that you should be careful with whom you do business and get the agreement in writing.
Pat: contractual temptation: late payment clause - double payment due if payment is more than one month following billing...if the credit card companies can play...
Me: Good one, Pat.
Amy, I agree that you should choose your clients carefully and that getting things in writing is important but those alone don't automatically solve the problem. My point is that the problem is not for-profit vs non-profit. It happens in both arenas.
