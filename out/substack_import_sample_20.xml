  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni">Pat Lencioni</a>, the team book writer/expert (disclosure: though we&#039;ve had the same publisher, I&#039;ve never read his books, so apologies to him), says so in <a href="http://www.catholicbusinessjournal.biz/Blogs/?p=111">The Catholic Reporter</a>. OK, not exactly. Here&#039;s the precise quote:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px">&quot;..one of the most frequently asked questions I get has to do with
managing groups of people who are geographically dispersed, a.k.a.
virtual teams. This surprises me a little because the topic, as well as
the solution for addressing it, is certainly not very sexy.&quot;<br /><br /></div><p>I&#039;ll skip the next couple of possible paragraphs of speculation about how face-to-face teams might or might not be sexy, depending on the circumstances, and go directly to Lencioni&#039;s ideas about how to make virtual teams better, or, I guess, less not-sexy.</p><p>I quote again: &quot;Once a team understands the disadvantage of not being co-located, then
it will be more likely to take on the next mistake that virtual teams
make: wasting the precious time that they do spend together.&quot;</p><p>Read the research, Pat. Disadvantage has been turned to supreme advantage. See just about anything on the <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/">NetAge Library</a> page and particularly, &quot;<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b01/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=R0405J">Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger?</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.milestone-group.com/media/october_2007_invitation.html">The Strange Beauty of Virtual Teams</a>.&quot; And there is no prerequisite, no iron-clad rule that says that face-to-face is the only way to launch a virtual team. Or that it even necessarily produces superior results.</p><p>But rather than play the part of the cynic-critic (even if I find people throwing out ideas about this as if they were really well informed), I&#039;ll leave it here: When Lencioni says, &quot;What teams have to do—and I told you up front that this is simple and
unsexy—is make a serious commitment to one another that they will
maintain a high standard of behavior during conference calls, even
higher than they would for an in-person meeting,&quot; I have no disagreement except that it&#039;s just not enough.</p><p>There is evidence, and plenty of it, that commitment is not enough. There are practices, outlined extensively in the above research and by numerous other thinkers, that turn conference calls into superb, better-than-in-person events. Combine the best practices of virtual teams in your face-to-face groups and ooo-la-la. Veddy sexy. And very effective, Mr. Lencioni.</p><p>Uh-oh, I just can&#039;t leave it without mentioning the new media tools. Much as I believe in the &quot;90% people, 10% technology&quot; dictum that we&#039;ve been espousing forever, those 10% tools have gotten so remarkably better in the past few years that mentioning virtual teams without encouraging use of the new media is, well, uninformed.</p><p></p>

When working with teams that are primarily distributed, in fact I encourage the first formation to be online, not F2F, because it tests and verifies our online "antennae" which we really need.

  <title>Ok, I goofed - it's not Verizon's fault, no, no</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it turns out that Verizon bears no responsibility for <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/03/ivan-seidenberg.html">my email problems</a>. They spun off <a href="http://ir.idearc.com/">Idearc</a> and now only market Idearc's email and web hosting. A friendly fellow with the title of &quot;Executive Customer Relations&quot; responded to my email to Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg with this: &quot;I will refer your issue to their CEO, Kathy Harless' office for handling.&quot;</p>
<p>You can write the next sentence yourself. Nothing has happened.</p>
<p>Except for this: continuing email from Idearc's Tech Support explaining the difference to me between GMT 0 and GMT -4, telling me that I don't know how to attach documents to email, asking me for the same long headers of emails that I've sent multiple times....AARRGGHHH!!!</p>
<p>But there's a bright side. I'm gathering terrific material for an article (never mind all these blog posts).</p>
<p>One last thing: I've looked at Idearc's site and cannot figure out what this company actually does. Can you? &quot;Idearc consists primarily of assets, liabilities, businesses and
employees engaged in the delivery of our multi-platform suite of
advertising products.&quot;</p>
<p>If anyone has a suggestion for a good email/web hosting solution for small business, please let me know. </p>

Otherwise, they would probably be off the map. We had negotiated a strategy for advertising with Superpages, but elected not to go forward with it, not only because of it&#x27;s relatively low ranking, but out of fear they would mess it up beyond belief like our YP listing. We have evidence that they cannot deliver on what they promise- especially on their performance reporting. There seems to be very little recourse against this leviathan organization- Idearc has many complaints against it for business practice and non-customer service.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My fellow bloggers will appreciate this problem: much to blog about, little time to blog. So it is that a compelling presentation by <a href="http://www.digitaltribe.com/stewsutton">Stew Sutton</a> of <a href="http://www.aero.org/">The Aerospace Corporation</a> at the <a href="http://www.leadershipforuminc.com/forums/klf.htm">Knowledge Leadership Forum</a> week before last has not gotten its due. As I've said before, one of the unnoticed benefits of being a speaker is <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/09/send-the-portra.html">hearing other speakers</a> (viz. <a href="http://robingerber.com/">Robin Gerber</a>), as I did at the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/execed/programs/leadershiplab.aspx">Brookings Leadership Lab</a> in September. Rarely does one (meaning this one) have the time but because the Knowledge Leadership Forum took place within quick driving distance, it was possible to hang out.</p>
<p>Stew was the person who really introduced me to <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>, the online virtual world where people create digital versions of themselves (or of the beings they wish they were). I wrote a bit about <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/rules-for-secon.html">IBM's guidelines for Second Life</a> a few months back. In truth, I first learned about Second Life only 18 months ago from that serial tracker of new things digital, <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a>, who calls himself Chief of Confusion. Like a couple of million other people, I logged in after talking to Stew. If you're there, you're unlikely to find me teleporting around but should you be curious, search for Pesha Linden. I chose the name Pesha for reasons known to my family and a few close friends; the name Linden was available on a list and I went right for it: my last name, original spelling Lipniak, means &quot;linden tree&quot; (or white wood, depending on whom you ask) in Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Of course, now that I have time to write this post, I can't find my notes from Stew's great presentation. He showed us all the cool things that his company, possibly the very first company to use Second Life, to support collaboration. Freed from the physics of our little planet, things fly and float and pulse and disappear in the Aerospace collaboratorium (they don't call it that but it deserves such a grand term). Astrophysicists can stand in the spray of rockets; they can invent new ways for rockets to spray. Very, very cool and apologies to Stew for the poor reportage (my early editors would be upset with me).</p>
<p>Here's the one fact I remember: you can have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(virtual_reality)">avatar</a>, meaning a digital version of yourself, made these days for $300. I mean something that looks like you. $300. Three bills for the virtual you.</p>

The &quot;pen computer&quot; is now coming of age.  This is a wonderful device that works in combination with special paper (with a barely visible micro-dot pattern).  The pen records the authors strokes on the paper and the traditional “ink” is put down on the paper just like with a regular (non-computer) pen.  The combination is absolutely amazing.

Leapfrog offers a product called the “Fly Fusion™” Pentop Computer (http://www.flyworld.com/whatis/index.html) aimed at the Junior High to High School market.  I’ve had one for a month or so and my younger daughter (5th grade) really enjoys it.  She is taking “digital notes” and often uses the built-in algebra programs to help he “check her homework answers.”  Dad verified that it was a post-solve check.

They are planning to start shipping their products in early 2008.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/10/eleanor_cover.jpg"><img width="200" height="200" border="0" alt="Eleanor_cover" title="Eleanor_cover" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/eleanor_cover.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
One of the unsung benefits of public speaking is that every now and again you're on the program with another speaker who inspires and expands awareness. This happened to me tonight at a weeklong &quot;Leadership Lab&quot; sponsored by the Brookings Institution where I have one of the speaking slots (&quot;Virtual Teams in the Age of the Network&quot;).</p>
<p>Tonight, <a href="http://www.robingerber.com">Robin Gerber</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Eleanor-Roosevelt-Robin-Gerber/dp/0735203245"><em>Leadership the Eleanor Roosevelt Way</em></a>, among other books, was the after-dinner speaker for this group of government officials. Robin is a compelling presenter with a great message: optimism, commitment, and the ability to let things go all combine to produce the Eleanor Roosevelts of the world.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt was one of <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/09/love-each-other.html">my mother's</a> heroines and, as Robin told stories, I could hear my mother's voice. But there was one story Robin told that I'd never heard before, one that will certainly stay with me.</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt died suddenly in 1945 at &quot;the Little White House&quot; in Warm Springs, Georgia, where the literally &quot;warm springs&quot; helped in soothing his polio. Many who know the Roosevelts' lives know that Lucy Mercer Rutherford, Eleanor's social secretary and the woman with whom Franklin had had an affair, supposedly several decades earlier, was with him when he died. Rutherford had arranged for her friend, an artist, to be there as well, to paint President Roosevelt's portrait. He was sitting for the portrait when he had a stroke and died.</p>
<p>Eleanor arrived from Washington almost immediately, where she learned from a spiteful cousin that Rutherford was with the president when he died. It was a very low blow for Eleanor, who had been promised by her husband that the affair had ended long before. Quickly, Eleanor dismantled the houses they had lived in, finding among their possessions this last portrait. What did she do with it? She sent it to Lucy Mercer Rutherford. As Robin said, &quot;She sent the portrait back,&quot; a metaphor for Eleanor's quite astonishing ability to move on, to not stay mired in the painful past.</p>
<p>Send the portraits back. Let go of what holds us back, even if a source of great pain. We all need to learn how to do this, myself at the top of the list. Thank you, Robin, for this wise counsel. By the way, Robin is, in fact, an attorney, and will see her first novel published come January: <em>Eleanor vs. Ike,</em> a fictional account of what might have happened had the great icon of women's (and human) rights run against the general in the 1952 US presidential election.</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Agreed, entirely. I've told this story several times since and each retelling gives me chills. Knowing what/who to keep and what/who to edit out is one key to a more open (and contributory) life, yes?</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is in the news and it&#039;s not the first time he&#039;s been center stage.</em></p>
<p><em>Students of the Iraq War may recall that <em>at the start of the war,&#160;</em>Shinseki, a four-star general, was the Chief of Staff of the Army who got into a public row with then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over troop strength. Shinseki said the US needed on the order of 250,000 troops in Iraq once the war wound down. In a clear rebuke, Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz made it known that they disagreed and Shinseki was forced out of his post.</em></p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Shinseki&#039;s view was vindicated and supported across the aisle and in The White House.</em></p>
<p><em>It was precisely when this was happening in the spring of 2003 that <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/jeff-stamps/" target="_self">Jeff Stamps</a> and I came into contact with General Shinseki, something we neither planned nor ever imagined. We pulled that story together for an unpublished book, &quot;Leading Networks,&quot; and, given Shinseki&#039;s prominence at the moment, I think it&#039;s worth retelling here</em>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>On February 10, 2003, I answered the phone and found an unlikely caller. &quot;I&#039;m calling on behalf of (then-) Major General Jim Dubik,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#039;d like you to come to a wargame.&quot;</p>
<p>Unified Quest 03, the aide explained, would be the first Joint Forces-US Army Wargame, a weeklong simulation that would take place at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We would be among a small group of outsiders; the other 700 people would be from military forces both in the U.S. and among American allies and from defense contracting firms.</p>
<p>I said that I&#039;d never heard of General Dubik. &quot;Well, he’s heard of you&quot;, the aide replied, explaining that Dubik had read and been interested in <em>The Age of the Network,</em> a book we’d written ten years earlier.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841021.jpg"><img alt="Dubik" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401a73dc89a8d970d img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841019.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Dubik" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Lt. Gen. Jim Dubik, now retired, photo from <a href="https://law.psu.edu/news/dubik_accepts_bradley_chair" target="_self">Penn State Dickinson School of Law site</a>,</em><br /><em>where he holds the&#160;Gen. Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership</em></p>
<p>Jeff was as flabbergasted as I when I went into his study to tell him.</p>
<p>We had met as anti-Vietnam War activists in 1968 while students at Oxford University.</p>
<p>In contrast to some of our friends in 2003 who argued with us, we strongly opposed the then-looming Iraq War.</p>
<p>We decided to attend.</p>
<p>And then we told our friends what we were planning to do. Invariably we got the same reply: “You’re going to be doing <em>what</em>?” Then quickly, nearly all followed with, “Thank God. I’m so glad you’re going.”</p>
<p>Thus began our involvement with the American military, particularly the Army, where we’ve discovered that some of its ideas, particularly in regard to leadership, are ahead of those we&#039;ve encountered as consultants in the commercial and non-profit sectors.</p>
<p>To attend a wargame was beyond our ken. So it was with apprehension, curiosity, and a little discomfort that we went to the Carlisle Barracks, reflected in a summary I wrote after the event:</p>
<p>&quot;My coming-in-picture of a &#039;wargame?&#039; I thought it would be fought in a space the size of at least a basketball court, maybe even as large as the hangar I once toured at Douglas Aircraft where the MD-11 was being built.</p>
<p>&quot;And, I wasn’t sure precisely what would transpire on this &#039;battlefield.&#039; I thought it was unlikely that we&#039;d find people playing laser tag or paintball, but I wasn’t even certain of that. I was unprepared for the wargame to be &#039;fought&#039; in crowded conference rooms, where it was hard to hear what people were saying and where the commander’s back was usually turned toward most of those in the room.&quot;</p>
<p>The wargame&#160;that (now-retired Lieutenant General) Dubik invited us to—in this case, a thinly disguised confrontation with a country called “Nair” (unscramble the letters)—included our attending the daily debriefings for the&#160;“flag officer” (read highest-ranking officers) at the end of each day. There, the senior military strategists, many retired, would deconstruct the day’s wargame results.</p>
<p>Following the opening session at the War College’s Bliss Hall, which I remember as being very loud and filled with promotional videos for various weapons and tanks, Bill Rittenhouse, then a career staffer for the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command and an organizer of the event, found us stumbling around, unsure of what to do next or where to go. He welcomed us, indicating that he wasn’t quite certain what we were supposed to be doing either, but immediately introduced us to Clint Ancker, a retired colonel doing research on the Army’s structure and director of the famed Center for Army Lessons Learned.</p>
<p>We knew who Ancker was because one of his aides had been corresponding with us over the prior few months on “echelonment.” The word, from the French, literally means rungs on a ladder, and is the term the military uses to describe its levels of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Ancker and his group had been tasked with responding to a “request” from the then-Secretary of Defense. Now that the forces were “joint,” meaning that they all had to play nice together, Rumsfeld wanted the Army to remove a level, an echelon, from its traditional command structure, a rung near the top. Over lunch, Ancker drew some pictures about options for the Army’s reorganization, which reassured us that our expertise in networks had some relevance to what they were working on.</p>
<p>From that informative lunch, Ancker moved us along to meet then-Brigadier General (later Lieutenant General) Mike Vane, a self-described California beach boy in his youth, and one of the conference co-chairs.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841021-1.jpg"><img alt="Vane" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401a3fd0dbd3e970b img-responsive" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mt_imported_image_1757841019-1.jpg" style="width: 250px;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Vane" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Lieutenant General Mike Vane, now retired, photo from <a href="http://www.army.mil/article/48544/strengthening-ties-between-army-capabilities-engineering/" target="_self">US Army site</a></p>
<p>Vane, in turn, took us into a small room to wait for General Dubik. “Hi, I’m Jim Dubik,” said the informally dressed general, extending his hand as he walked in.</p>
<p>After the usual pleasantries, we asked the central questions: “Why are we here and what do you want us to do?” Dubik responded in a way that we’ve become accustomed to in working with senior executives.</p>
<p>“I don’t know precisely,” he said. “I read your book about networks. We’re fighting a networked enemy. We have a net-centric warfare strategy in place. And we’re responding to the SecDef’s request for material on echelonment.”</p>
<p>Dubik told us to “wander around” and to try to absorb as much as we could as quickly as possible, and to reflect back what we noticed. He asked that we pay attention to “jointness” (how the separate forces worked together) and “echelonment,” in particular, but cautioned us not to artificially limit our scope.</p>
<p>These intriguingly broad terms of reference allowed us to follow an unscripted flow. After a tour of the wargame premises by one of Vane’s aides, we were, for the most part, left on our own.</p>
<p>Over the following week, we talked with dozens of people both formally and informally. We sat in on sessions where specific maneuvers were debated in snatches and at length. We shared meals with generals and admirals, trading health tips and nutrition theories with a four-star. We exchanged references with analysts, media, and advisors.</p>
<p>And, we attended the highest-level meeting of our lives, an “out-brief,” military-speak for what business refers to as a post-mortem, with the Joint Chiefs.</p>
<p>On the last day of the wargame, General Shinseki arrived to hear the conclusions of the exercises. It was one of the rare events that we weren&#039;t invited to but when it was over, the ground crew involved with putting on the event—the schleppers, the logistics people, and the sponsoring senior military officers, including Dubik and Vane—stood in a line as Shinseki spoke to them, thanking each individually.</p>
<p>Everyone knew what was happening—indeed, Shinseki&#039;s disagreement with the Bush administration over troop strength required in Iraq, an estimate that later proved to be entirely accurate, had been broadcast on television—and sadness seeped across the floor just beneath the evident respect that seemed to pour from people&#039;s eyes. Shinseki then walked down the line, pressing a medal commemorating the wargame into the hand of each person who&#039;d worked the event. After the meet-and-greet, Dubik pressed one into each of our hands.</p>
<p>The next day, we drove south from Carlisle to Fort McNair in Washington for the “Senior Leaders Seminar,” the last event of this historic wargame. There, the generals and admirals who orchestrated the wargame, along with a handful of participants from the Carlisle exercises, met with the military&#039;s top brass, including the Chief of Naval Operations, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the Supreme Allied Commander of Atlantic, along with their peers—as well as the then-Deputy Secretary of Defense, Wolfowitz. Of the ninety guests, as best we could determine we were the only true civilians, and I was the only woman. We were seated just behind Wolfowitz and the Army Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>This gathering at the National Defense University took place the very day after then-President Bush landed on the USS Lincoln to proclaim “Mission Accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>General Shinseki led the proceedings. Seated to his left was Wolfowitz, who arrived late and left barely ten minutes later, just moments after the briefing began. (An aide came in, handed him a note, and he said that he had to leave because &quot;the Secretary needs me.&quot;)</p>
<p>Surely Wolfowitz could not have wanted to hear the words of one retired four-star Air Force general who said plainly, “Preemption does not work.” Preemption, the Bush administration policy employed in the Iraq War, the general said, violated the principles of war, left the enemy no choice but to respond with unconventional methods (meaning weapons of mass destruction), and placed the preempting forces without any of their conventional means of applying pressure incrementally.</p>
<p>This “After Action Review,” the systematic method the Army developed for reviewing its “actions,” included a ten-minute video positioning the history and chronology of this particular wargame, emerging issues identified by the wargame teams, and feedback from those participating.</p>
<p>We were told that this meeting was historic: It was the first time the highest levels of US military had convened as a network of peers for a wargame debriefing. Hot on the heels of the initial and what then appeared to have been the stunningly successful invasion of Iraq—reportedly the most &quot;joint&quot; operation in history—was “a not-to-be-missed opportunity,” which is how Admiral Vern Clark, then the Chief Naval Officer, described it to us as we were leaving.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted for a few hours; our involvement with the military lasted for another five years until the last of the crop of senior officers whom we knew retired.</p>
<p>What we took away was that while the “joint” approach to military affairs as practiced at this wargame is still being worked out, it is evident that the complexity of global relations in the 21st century demands it.</p>
<p>The immediate, mind-boggling dilemma of security in a pre-emptive, time-warped world with unpredictable enemies who have access to unthinkable weapons no longer allows individual and separate hierarchies to march forward.</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Hi Jessica,
This is great stuff.
There is an FM (field manual) for the After Action Review.
Network warfare is discussed in the RAND papers called In Athens's Camp (Chapter 19 starting on page 455).
The learning required to move to action under chaos is critical. Burt Maggart MG (RET) has an obscure paper that sets out a framework for situational awareness and leadership that is really helpful.
Best regards,
Hal</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/13/salamander.jpg"><img width="100" height="156" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/salamander.jpg" title="Salamander" alt="Salamander" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
I had a period a few years ago when, on the train to or from New York, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/come-with-me-me.html">next to me was seated a writer</a>. Always. I've posted here about my adventures meeting <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/11/let-them-be-sea.html">another writer</a> time and again in the nut aisle at Whole Foods. (We met for coffee there earlier this week, a location she proposed in an email with the subject line, &quot;chock full 'o nuts.&quot;)</p>
<p>A few very close to me say it's my fault, that I strike up these conversations, that these poor writers likely cherish their privacy and I'm barging in on their otherwise contemplative lives.</p>
<p>Explain this, then. Yesterday, coffee (though first I had green tea and then water) with <a href="http://halrichman.com/">Hal Richman</a>, whom I've corresponded with over the years about collaboration, virtual teams, and the like. Hal was passing through on his way from Nova Scotia&nbsp; to Indonesia and happened to be staying here in Newton, Mass. for a night.</p>
<p>We talked so long that we closed up one joint (don't get excited, closing time is 4 PM on Saturdays) and moved to a second coffee shop, across the street, although, again, no coffee was involved. (He had ice cream, this was when I drank the water.)</p>
<p>Yammer, yammer, we went, what about this connection, what about that...and off I was talking about the trend whereby <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/bellevue-hospit.html">medical institutions</a><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/bellevue-hospit.html">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/bellevue-hospit.html">now also are literary publishers</a> (Bellevue Hospital in NY, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, a few others). Bellevue also publishes books, I said, repeating what I'd read in the NY Times (not just on some unreliable blog).</p>
<p>At the next table were a mother and daughter (also eating ice cream). We smiled and I noticed that she had on a cool brown suede vest with no collar, nice buttons.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry for eavesdropping but Bellevue is publishing books?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>She must have seen the question about to come out of my mouth. &quot;I publish a literary journal,&quot; said she, poet <a href="http://www.cervenabarvapress.com/barberinterview.htm">Jenny Barber</a>, founder and editor of <a href="http://media.cas.suffolk.edu/salamander/content.php?page=about&amp;n=4&amp;f=2">Salamander</a>, now in its 15th year and housed at Suffolk University in Boston.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most Sundays, <a href="http://www.elizastamps.com">Daughter #2</a> and I discuss a single column in The New York Times. Not infrequently, our inner snarks emerge as we eviscerate &quot;Modern Love,&quot; the 1500-word essays that appear in Sunday Styles. We haven&#039;t had the chance to compare notes yet on &quot;<a name="articleBodyLink"></a><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/fashion/28love.html?scp=1&amp;sq=raising%20a%20princess&amp;st=cse">Raising a Princess Single-Handedly</a>,&quot; but I&#039;m guessing she, along with you, will choke up a bit and cheer its warmth and evident </span><span>devotion</span><span>.</span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.simonvanbooy.com/">Simon Van Booy</a> and his four-year-old Madeleine are busy making life appear normal after the sudden death of his wife/her mother last year from Marfan syndrome. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s because my best friend, <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2007/07/my-friend-linda.html">Linda</a>, died of Marfan&#039;s that this piece causes me to pull my laptop into the garden and post in these few moments when it&#039;s not raining.</span></p><p><span>This tender reflection, circling the simple gesture of making breakfast, manages to draw in everything from Sleeping Beauty to the trick of buying store-brand cereal and pouring it into the colorful boxes of crap that children prefer to World War II in one effortless stream.</span></p><p><span>Witness this from the guy with the funny hat, cane, and mustache, who also takes a bow: &quot;</span>I think it was Charlie Chaplin who said that close up, human life is tragic, but from a distance, it’s funny.&quot;</p><p>Or how about this capture of a certain aspect of the secret life of children:</p><blockquote><p>We don’t have television, so Hannah
Montana entered our lives on a DVD purchased because Madeleine had
somehow found out about her through that underground toy-smuggling and
gossip network also known as nursery school.</p></blockquote><p>Turns out Mr. Van Booy is a writer of some repute, with books in print and in the pipeline: his new story collection, <em>Love Begins in Winter</em>, is just out, joining <em>The Secret Lives of People in Love</em> (I swear I didn&#039;t see the title until after I&#039;d written the line about the secret lives of children); coming soon, <em>Why We Need Love, Why People Fight,</em> and a few more. Prolific to boot.</p><p>Do the clickeroo. You&#039;ll thank me and we&#039;ll both thank Simon and Madeleine. The title of this post, taken from the piece, is self-explanatory.</p><p></p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you love them, you are very happy. We all do/are. The Red Sox are on fire (never mind the Pats but that would take too long to cover :).</p>
<p>You know, because you keep up with this and many other arcane stats about the Sox, that they ARE first in the American League East division FOR the first time since 1995.</p>
<p>Baseball is all about playoffs. This one begins tomorrow night, just after sunset, at sacred Fenway Park here in Boston.</p>
<p>I know my friend, Ron Currie Sr, father of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Dead-Jr-Ron-Currie/dp/0670038679">God is Dead</a> author, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/07/july-07-book-cl.html">Ron C Jr</a>, is incredibly happy. He was wearing his Sox cap the first time I met him.</p>
<p>I'm wearing mine too...while my friend June wears her Red Sox pajamas and many others put on their talis(wo)mans of good luck. Go Sox.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Recently, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.soxfanuniversity.com/"><em>How to Talk to a Yankee Fan</em></a> by Andy Wasif and Rick D'Elia. Excellent for irritating &quot;Yankee&quot; (singular) fans.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Take a listen to my colleague, <a href="http://thefutureofwork.net/" target="_self">Jim Ware</a>&#039;s interview last night, on Turi Ryder&#039;s WGN radio show on &quot;<a href="http://wgnradio.com/2013/02/27/the-perks-and-catches-of-working-remotely/" target="_self">The perks and catches of working remotely</a>.&quot; Jim&#039;s been thinking about where work is headed for a very long time and is a thoughtful commentator. He is clear that he hasn&#039;t studied Yahoo! but, when pressed for what he would say to the company, he pointed out that there is a larger issue here than where people are working. &quot;It used to be we all had to go to the office if we wanted to see people or access our paper files...the office is now operating in a free market. <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/marissa-mayer/" target="_self">Marissa Mayer</a> should have known this and maybe she does... but these companies need to create an office work environment where people want to be there.&quot;

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica, thanks for this. Your summary of my conversation with Turi is far better than anything I could have written.
Maybe Marissa Mayer knows what she's doing and why, but we have to wonder if she understands what's really going on.
My point is simple:  if Yahoo! doesn't know what its remote employees are doing, or how they are performing, that reflects basic shortcomings in Yahoo!'s performance management systems. If managers do not trust employees, or know the status of their work, that's not the employees' fault.</wp:comment_content>

<p>Two waiting last night:</p><p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/04/the-handbook-fo.html"><strong>The Handbook of High-Performance Virtual Teams</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470176423.html">all 764 pages of it</a>.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's Saturday here in the USA (and nearly Sun where some close family members happen to be at the moment) so I thought I'd torment everyone who's been in my kitchen with the virtual smell of Nova Scotia Pancakes (recipe below).</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this recipe while sailing in The Bahamas with my father-in-law and his cabinmate at the time, a woman who loved to cook. Without aid of good refrigeration (my f-i-l had built his own fridge, seriously, from an air conditioner), a hand-beater, or even a key ingredient (buttermilk) Lillian managed to produce the fluffiest, tastiest little circles of delectability.</p>
<p>So scrumptious are these 'cakes that I wrote them into a novel. (Nothing like quoting oneself):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The day after we married, Tonin and I did the cooking, serving our trademark meal, Nova Scotia pancakes, the sweet puffs of perfection that bubbled on the griddle when my mother smiled on the kitchen. An egg yolk and a tablespoon of melted butter for each person, a little more buttermilk than flour, laced with a smidgen of baking powder and baking soda, fluffed with egg whites whipped stiff then stirred in without losing a molecule of air. Tonin wielded the large metal mixing spoon, still shining after 50 years of use, the indentations on the handle worn where so many cooks’ hands had left marks of their wedding rings, scooping the batter from the bowl as carefully as if he were swaddling a newborn. I knew by the way he eased the mixture from the spoon onto the skillet that he was the father I wanted for my children.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now the recipe, also available with many other good ones, here at <a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/recipes/recipes.html">Turkeynose</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My Mom's Nova Scotia Pancakes
Serves 4 (but if you have teenagers eating, double it; if carb-conscious eaters, don't bother to serve them; they don't deserve it:)
</p>
<p>4 large eggs, separated, plus one extra egg white<br />
4 tbsp melted butter<br />
1 1/2 c flour<br />
1 tsp baking powder<br />
1 tsp baking soda<br />
1 2/3 c buttermilk </p>
<p>Melt butter, cool slightly in fridge. In small bowl combine flour, baking soda, baking powder; set aside. Beat egg whites stiff; set aside. In large bowl, beat egg yolks and add melted butter. Alternately, add flour combo and buttermilk to the yolk-butter mixture. When it's still quite thick (stretch bubbles appear on the surface of the batter), stop adding buttermilk, even if you haven't used the full measure (depends on humidity, temperature, and all those other imponderable factors that wreck recipes). Then fold in whites very gently. Get the griddle/pan very hot and cook a &quot;test&quot; cake. When bubbles form on the surface, flip it over. You'll know by the color whether the pan is ready for the rest (you're looking for golden brown). Cook to perfection. In our house, we have a tradition of eating the first 'cake without anything on it. Then let 'er rip. Butter and the real maple syrup. In August here in New England, where berries have their moment, we had blueberries to the batter, in which case, reduce the buttermilk slightly as the moisture in the berries takes its place. If you don't have buttermilk on hand, sour regular milk with lemon juice or vinegar, wait patiently for ten minutes, and your recipe will still work reasonably well.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nova Spivack, one of the smarter people I've met, has a thoughtful post calling for an end to artificial intelligence and recommending that we replace it with &quot;<a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2008/01/artificial-stup.html">Artificial Stupidity: The Next Big Thing</a>.&quot; Why? Because:</p><blockquote><p>We are terrible organizers. We are lazy, messy, inconsistent, and we make all kinds of errors by accident. We are terrible at tagging and linking as well, it turns out. We are terrible at coordinating or tracking multiple things at once because we are easily overloaded and we can really only do one thing well at a time. These kinds of tasks are just not what our brains are good at. That's what computers are for - or should be for at least.</p>
<p>Humans are really good at higher level cognition: complex thinking, decisionmaking, learning, teaching, inventing, expressing, exploring, planning, reasoning, sensemaking, and problem solving -- but we are just terrible at managing email, or making sense of the Web. Let's play to our strengths and use computers to compensate for our weaknesses.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. Just take a look at my desk. And table. and the desk next to that. Enough said. I'm pretty dubm.</p>

    <wp:comment_content>Since getting my Kindle I have been reading more and feeling less smart. However, I am better organized because I now only have one book.  It is hard to have a messy shelf with one book.</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Take a bow, Boston</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers of The Boston Globe may not have noticed yesterday&#039;s astonishing headline on Page 1 of Metro, even though it occupied prime real estate: &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/13/boston_escapes_2009_with_no_fire_deaths/">Boston escapes &#039;09 with no fire deaths</a>.&quot; John R. Ellement did not bury the lead:</p><blockquote><p>Last year, for the first time in at least 37 years, no one was killed
by fire in Boston, a historic accomplishment for the Boston Fire
Department whose leaders yesterday credited increased public awareness
and “boots on the street’’ for the success.</p><p>Fire Commissioner Roderick Fraser said 2009 was the first time since at
least 1972, when the Fire Department started keeping detailed
information on fatalities, that no one lost their life in a
fire-related incident in the city. “We think that’s fantastic,’’ he
said.</p></blockquote><p>We spent a number of years working with fire departments around the U.S., promoting fire prevention education (the same program that resulted in the famous Dick Van Dyke commercial memorable for its tag line, &quot;Stop, drop, and roll&quot;), a largely ignored field until the establishment of what&#039;s now called the U.S. Fire Administration. While things have improved quite a bit since we trudged around the country, interviewing fire safety officers in such far-flung places as Arlington Heights, Illinois, Riverside, Calif., and Dade County, Florida, the U.S. still has one of the highest fire death rates in the world.</p><p>Why? Because our fire safety focus remains on public buildings, not where we live. And devastating fires do happen, even to people who are extremely safety conscious and have the right equipment installed, viz., our close friends who watched as their house burned down recently, the fire likely caused by a wiring problem, while firefighters lost precious time looking for the fire hydrant, buried under snow.</p><p>Perhaps this was a fluke and city officials knew where every other hydrant was situated...not the point I&#039;m trying to make. Just want to laud Boston firefighters and the residents of Boston for a year of no deaths from fire. Truly worthy of a very big headline. Meanwhile, check your smoke detectors, know where your closest hydrants are, and be sure you and everyone in your family knows how to get out of the house if you do have a fire. As our friends, whose equanimity in the face of having lost all their possessions is beyond inspiring, continue to remind those who console them, &quot;It&#039;s just stuff.&quot; They were not harmed and their loss allows all who love them to give in myriad ways, which makes us all a little larger.</p>

  <title>Ten rules for writing (fiction) via The Guardian</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Doug Lea has a good eye for fresh material. &quot;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one">Ten rules for writing fiction</a>&quot; from The Guardian is purportedly about writing fiction but...take a read and you&#039;ll see why I put the word in parens in the title. Novelists of note list their pointers. Having just read and loved Margaret Atwood&#039;s <em><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780385528771-7">The Year of the Flood</a></em> (despite my aversion to dystopian fiction, this novel is barely a quarter-inch off reality), I went right to her ten:</p><blockquote><p><strong>1 </strong>Take a pencil to write with on aeroplanes. Pens
leak. But if the pencil breaks, you can&#039;t sharpen it on the plane,
because you can&#039;t take knives with you. Therefore: take two pencils.</p><p><strong>2 </strong>If both pencils break, you can do a rough sharpening job with a nail file of the metal or glass type.</p><p><strong>3 </strong>Take something to write on. Paper is good. In a pinch, pieces of wood or your arm will do.</p><p><strong>4</strong> If you&#039;re using a computer, always safeguard new text with a ­memory stick.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Do back exercises. Pain is distracting.</p><p><strong>6 </strong>Hold
the reader&#039;s attention. (This is likely to work better if you can hold
your own.) But you don&#039;t know who the reader is, so it&#039;s like shooting
fish with a slingshot in the dark. What ­fascinates A will bore the
pants off B.</p><p><strong>7 </strong>You most likely need a thesaurus,
a rudimentary grammar book, and a grip on reality. This latter means:
there&#039;s no free lunch. Writing is work. It&#039;s also gambling. You don&#039;t
get a pension plan. Other people can help you a bit, but ­essentially
you&#039;re on your own. ­Nobody is making you do this: you chose it, so
don&#039;t whine.</p><p><strong>8</strong> You can never read your own book
with the innocent anticipation that comes with that first delicious
page of a new book, because you wrote the thing. You&#039;ve been backstage.
You&#039;ve seen how the rabbits were smuggled into the hat. Therefore ask a
reading friend or two to look at it before you give it to anyone in the
publishing business. This friend should not be someone with whom you
have a ­romantic relationship, unless you want to break up.</p><p><strong>9</strong>
Don&#039;t sit down in the middle of the woods. If you&#039;re lost in the plot
or blocked, retrace your steps to where you went wrong. Then take the
other road. And/or change the person. Change the tense. Change the
opening&#160;page.</p><p><strong>10</strong> Prayer might work. Or reading
­something else. Or a constant visual­isation of the holy grail that is
the finished, published version of your resplendent book.</p></blockquote><p>**</p>

Good grief.
Have they never seen a "click" (automatic) pencil?

  <title>Is your toilet running?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do inanimate objects have lives of their own? When we first started buying cars, ours were Saabs, one after another, this when they were still made in Sweden. Shortly after we bought our first one, sight unseen from a used car leader in Vermont (a friend called to say that he&#039;d found the perfect car for us and we said, go for it, but not really, as that wasn&#039;t an expression then), we noticed a ding in the driver&#039;s door. Dings happen. Then we noticed that our friend, a Swede, by the way, had a ding in his Saab&#039;s driver door. Well, the rest of this paragraph is predictable. See a Saab, we noticed the same ding in the same spot.</p>
<p>So...what does this have to do with toilets? We have a very old house (even by European standards, it competes). And a couple of old toilets. A few weeks ago, one of the toilets started to run (it&#039;s doing so right now, for the record). You know the fix: jiggle the handle and hope it&#039;s happy. Then, last week, while visiting daughter #2, she said, &quot;Be sure to jiggle.&quot; Next, a visit to daughter #1, where, of course, all talk was of jiggling.</p>
<p>Tell me. Is this just a family-wide phenom or are you jiggling too?</p>

Workarounds abound. We accept a certain measure of slop in objects. Each of my two old Volvos have a short list of Things That Car Does. With the Wagon, it&#x27;s that, because of the rear gate wiring, on rainy days, hitting the brakes may turn on the rear defroster. There is a rational explanation for this, but it&#x27;s a pain to rewire the thing.<br/>The sedan? The blower fan gives off a high-frequency &quot;wickawickawicka&quot; sound. Not really noticeable until you turn it off then you wonder what that sound is. Oh yes. The rest of the car. I&#x27;d get it fixed, only the cost of the repair can exceed the value of the car. Seems Volvo designed the entire car around that fan, and you have to take most of the cabin apart to get to it.<br/>I work in IT. It is uncanny how people will work around computer problems and never mention them to a professional who could fix them. That is, until it&#x27;s too late.<br/>I guess that happens everywhere. My mechanic keeps telling me about how keeping up with the little things is less expensive in the long run. Yeah. But. I can just turn the radio up...</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Steve Teicher <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— September 21, 2007 at 04:19 AM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">We do not jiggle because we live in a motorhome so our toilet has a foot pedal. We have to snap rather than jiggle.<br/>It is amazing how hard it is to break habits. Some who use our toilet want to jiggle, but there is nothing to jiggle.<br/>There are many rituals  that full time rv&#x27;ers do that are unnatural acts to those of you living in fixed housing. For instance, we level and extend when we stop.  We also Walmart. I&#x27;ll bet most of you have never slept in a Walmart parking lot.<br/>We also worry about having a view of the southern sky from our coach. Do you know why?<br/>There is more if you care..</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">jessica lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— September 23, 2007 at 07:51 AM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">A view of the Southern Sky, Steve? Please expand, by all means.

For those with fixed roofs the installer takes care of it. If you have you antenna mounted on a roof that moves, you quickly learn that you need a spot where the trees and buildings and mountains let you see the southern sky from your antenna.<br/>I&#x27;ll write about other things you watch for if you are in a rolling home that might not be obvious to fixed dwellers.<br/>We are called &quot;full timers&quot; which means we do not have a fixed home.</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content>I think it's a human thing. Workarounds abound. We accept a certain measure of slop in objects. Each of my two old Volvos have a short list of Things That Car Does. With the Wagon, it's that, because of the rear gate wiring, on rainy days, hitting the brakes may turn on the rear defroster. There is a rational explanation for this, but it's a pain to rewire the thing.
The sedan? The blower fan gives off a high-frequency "wickawickawicka" sound. Not really noticeable until you turn it off then you wonder what that sound is. Oh yes. The rest of the car. I'd get it fixed, only the cost of the repair can exceed the value of the car. Seems Volvo designed the entire car around that fan, and you have to take most of the cabin apart to get to it.
I work in IT. It is uncanny how people will work around computer problems and never mention them to a professional who could fix them. That is, until it's too late.
I guess that happens everywhere. My mechanic keeps telling me about how keeping up with the little things is less expensive in the long run. Yeah. But. I can just turn the radio up...</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>We do not jiggle because we live in a motorhome so our toilet has a foot pedal. We have to snap rather than jiggle.
It is amazing how hard it is to break habits. Some who use our toilet want to jiggle, but there is nothing to jiggle.
There are many rituals  that full time rv'ers do that are unnatural acts to those of you living in fixed housing. For instance, we level and extend when we stop.  We also Walmart. I'll bet most of you have never slept in a Walmart parking lot.
We also worry about having a view of the southern sky from our coach. Do you know why?
There is more if you care..</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>The Southern Sky is what you have to see to get satellite reception. For those with fixed roofs the installer takes care of it. If you have you antenna mounted on a roof that moves, you quickly learn that you need a spot where the trees and buildings and mountains let you see the southern sky from your antenna.
I'll write about other things you watch for if you are in a rolling home that might not be obvious to fixed dwellers.
We are called "full timers" which means we do not have a fixed home.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><em>Kurt Cagle's &quot;<a href="http://news.oreilly.com/2008/08/is-telework-the-face-of-the-ag.html">Is Telework the New Face of the Agile Workforce?</a>&quot; is a love letter to all those wondering whether people who work at home are: 1. actually watching Oprah; and 2. thereby burning up a whole lot more watts. Say it ain't so! He does in a piece worth the clicky:</em></p><blockquote><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">...Sun's
ergonomics people connected P3 International's Kill A Watt meter, a
portable power meter that can connect into a workstation, onto both
their internal computer systems and the participants home (or mobile)
connections. What they discovered was that teleworkers consumed about
64 watts per hour, while their office counterparts consumed more than
double, 130 watts per hour, just on their equipment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Yet the vast benefit came in slashing
the commute. The energy costs involved in running office equipment
accounted for less than 2% of the total carbon footprint for an
employee, while almost all of the rest, 97%, was involved in the
commute to and from the office each day. By reducing trips to the
office to 2 ½ days a week, a typical employee managed to save
5,400 kilowatt hours per year, according to Kristi McGee, senior
director for Sun's Open Work services group.</p></blockquote><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"></p>

  <title>Text me your novel</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suppose it was inevitable but frankly it's never crossed my mind: writing a novel on my phone. Today's NY Times gives&nbsp; front page space to Norimitsu Onishi's very good reporting, &quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/world/asia/20japan.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1358571600&amp;en=80ecfafb315992fc&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin#">Thumbs Race as Japan's Best Sellers Go Cellular</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>That's right. Of the top ten best selling novels in Japan in 2007, <strong>five</strong> were written on cell phones.</p>
<p>Writers, get thee-selves to the thumb exercise gym. Writing your brilliant prose on your phone is the NBT, and if you don't know what that is, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations.asp#m">click here</a> (oh, no, it's not there: Next Big Thing):</p><blockquote><p> Whatever their literary talents, cellphone novelists are racking up
the kind of sales that most more experienced, traditional novelists can
only dream of.</p>
<p>One such star, a 21-year-old woman named Rin,
wrote “If You” over a six-month stretch during her senior year in high
school. While commuting to her part-time job or whenever she found a
free moment, she tapped out passages on her cellphone and uploaded them
on a popular Web site for would-be authors.</p></blockquote><p>Turns out that writing via this method owes its success in part to &quot;packet death.&quot; Huh? This special form of electronic extinction was befalling Japanese cellphone users when their text messaging bills were in the $1000 range. When providers changed their billing methods from charging by the message, the prevailing model here in the US, to charging flat fees for unlimited data transmission, they made it economical for people to post via their phones. Young writers, who got their start posting novels to their blogs, quickly made the transition to writing on their phones.</p>
<p>Thus, a new genre was born. Only the publishing establishment is not so sure it is a genre, which is where the literary tension comes in. Or not. The books tend not to have any, according to the article. Simple love stories, written with a lot of text abbreviations, little character development, and very short sentences seem to be the style.</p>
<p>I better brush up my texting skills. Or i btr brsh up my txtg skls.</p>
<p>Very interesting article. Worth reading.</p>

  <title>Another of the networking greats passes on: Seymour Sarason</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when we were <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/index.html">first writing about networks</a>, we received a letter (in the mail, that long ago), written on beautiful stationery. It was from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/nyregion/elizabeth-meyer-lorentz-87-scriptwriter.html?pagewanted=1">Elizabeth M. Lorentz</a>, who said that while she liked our book, we&#039;d missed a very important source of information: the books she&#039;d written with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/education/08sarason.html">Seymour Sarason</a> (who died on Jan. 28 in New Haven). She went on to point out that we&#039;d failed to recognize a critical role in networks, that of the coordinator, again a function that she and Sarason had identified.</p><p>Shame on us. We&#039;d missed their work entirely. In fact, we&#039;d never heard of either of them until the letter came, but, once it did, a friendship was born with Elizabeth that lasted until she died about ten years ago.</p><p>I could (and eventually will) write for pages about Elizabeth, her remarkable life, and what turned out to be an important friendship. Her father was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Meyer">Eugene Meyer</a>, first head of the World Bank, but that was only later in his life, after many other positions, including chairing the Federal Reserve Bank, and buying, at auction, The Washington Post, which Elizabeth&#039;s younger sister, Katharine Graham, would eventually run. The world passed through the doors of the Meyer home and, during the fifteen years of our friendship, I heard many stories about people whom I only knew from reading--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brancusi">Brancusi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Steichen">Steichen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin">Gershwin</a>, to name a few. The most important to our work was Seymour.</p><p>The Times obit that I linked to in the first paragraph reviews Seymour&#039;s remarkable contribution to psychology, which acknowledges the role of community in shaping people. I&#039;d never met Seymour face-to-face until Elizabeth died and her sister organized a memorial service in New York. At the luncheon following, I was seated between Seymour and Mrs. Graham. (Somehow he was instantly Seymour but I couldn&#039;t think of her as Kay.)</p><p>He was warm and funny, knew our work, and wanted me to come visit him in Connecticut. You no doubt have a list of such trips yourself, ones that you really want to make but never can make happen, say, next Tuesday. I&#039;m so grateful that I did make the time, many times over, to see Elizabeth and get to know her.</p><p>Seymour&#039;s and Elizabeth&#039;s work together, which began after she was well into her fifties, called out &quot;The Challenge of the Resource Exchange Network,&quot; the title of one of their books. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=Seymour%20B.%20Sarason">Seymour wrote dozens</a>, by the way.)</p><p>One of its central tenets lies close to the heart of all of us interested in networks: that we have a great deal to offer one another but we have to reach outside the narrow bounds of the organizations we serve in order to realize it--and to manifest what cross-boundary communication and sharing really make possible. Coordinators, back to that first letter from Elizabeth, are the people who can make this happen.</p><p>As I&#039;m madly trying to find some passages that describe what Elizabeth and Seymour were talking about, I&#039;ve put my fingers on a few pages in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Age-Network-Organizing-Principles-Century/dp/0939246716">The Age of the Network</a></em> on their work. Will post that too.</p><p>Meanwhile, a deep bow to the phenomenal body of work that you produced, Seymour, which we all need to study more closely.</p><p>And a huge public note to self: Stop delaying all those trips.</p><p></p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She lived for thirteen years after tests confirmed ovarian cancer, which she intuited long before that.&nbsp; She opened her sealed orders early, knew she was meant to dance, which she did until two days before she died on April 6, 2007. </p>
<p>Last night, two hundred members of <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2007/04/10/dorothy_hershkowitz_infused_dances_with_emotion/">Dorothy Hershkowitz'</a>s family celebrated her life. Sweet nibbles to welcome guests and then the curtain.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/30/dorothy_2.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dorothy_2.jpg" title="Dorothy_2" alt="Dorothy_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left;width: 116px;height: 171px" /></a>A forty-minute film that Dorothy narrates, a dance biography, with Dorothy looking to the filmmaker, Lynn Bikofsky, and talking to us. Dance has been her &quot;best friend,&quot; she says (at her funeral last April, the cantor recalled her saying that dance was her &quot;conversation with God&quot;). When things have been difficult, which they often were (we remember), she goes to her studio or at least &quot;the studio of my mind.&quot; Dance is where she works out life, realizes emotion, travels through space. We see clips of her as a very young dancer, and, remarkably, pieces of her major early works, <em>Kaddish,</em> which she choreographed and performed shortly after her father's death (I made seafood lasagna for the cast party), and <em>Monday Morning Quarterback, </em>inspired by an incident where she had to step over a drunk in a subway turnstile. She is still dancing at the end of the film: she had to repeat a take 30 times, 30, when she performs in the halls, not the auditorium, of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, because people keep walking into frame, the background narration a lab technician saying &quot;some people enjoy this test, find it relaxing,&quot; as Dorothy throws her body, just a few months before her death, from wall to wall with the knocks of the MRI. And then her teaching one of her last classes, frail, close to the end, her arms floating like no others, and the camera rests on her smile, her very beautiful smile.</p>
<p>People speak, beginning with the cantor, Lorel Zar-Kessler, and then many others. Poems, anecdotes, quotes from letters, a cello concert, cards, and emails Dorothy wrote, Dorothy-aware of death coming soon, her son, Alexander Bohn, recalling that she danced when she put away groceries, her students, her best friend in junior high, her cousin, all recalling a Dorothy the others recognized, and the brave tall man who said Dorothy was his icon of hope after his wife's ovarian cancer diagnosis because D had already lived seven years, (and, as it turned out, did live four years more after his wife died). Surely, as her husband, Dave Evans, <a href="www.partnershomecare.org/pdf/hspcnwsltrsmr07.pdf">has said</a>, her incredibly strong body, all those years of movement, extended her life.</p>
<p>And then they danced, 15 of her students, in a piece choreographed by Joanie Block to &quot;Smile.&quot; </p>
<p>Dave said the last words. Gratitude to all, composed and dignified, and very lovingly he tells of two things Dorothy said, the first a few moments after they met: &quot;She poured out her love, meaning Alexander and Jonathan, her sons;&quot; and her last, to the effect of: &quot;No one should go hungry - there is no reason for that.&quot;</p>
<p>And then we all sang &quot;You gotta have heart,&quot; words on the jump page here.</p>
<p>Repeating what I wrote when she died: <em>Dance on, Dorothy.</em></p>
<p><em>A nice <a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/newton/fun/entertainment/arts/x1681077249">article</a> in the Newton, Mass, newspaper where Dorothy lived.<br /></em></p>

<!--more-->
<p>Heart (from <a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/soundtracks/d/damnyankeeslyrics/heartlyrics.html">Damn Yankees</a>--no comment, ed.)</p>
<p>You've gotta have heart<br />
All you really need is heart<br />
When the odds are sayin' you'll never win<br />
That's when the grin should start</p>
<p>
You've gotta have hope<br />
Mustn't sit around and mope<br />
Nothin's half as bad as it may appear<br />
Wait'll next year and hope</p>
<p>
When your luck is battin' zero<br />
Get your chin up off the floor<br />
Mister you can be a hero<br />
You can open any door, there's nothin' to it but to do it</p>
<p>
You've gotta have heart<br />
Miles 'n miles n' miles of heart<br />
Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course<br />
But keep that old horse <br />
Before the cart</p>
<p>
First you've gotta have<br />
First you've gotta have<br />
First you've gotta have heart</p>
