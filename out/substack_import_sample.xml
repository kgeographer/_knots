  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="Plane" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842595.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left">So with no need for further explanation, you get the picture. Traveling earlier this week for a quick one-day with a lovely client, two workshops back-to-back. Flight, despite its customary lack of room, very pleasant, including the incredible good luck of sitting next to a Microsoft exec who, after hearing my woes with Word, hands me a &quot;magic card&quot; (his words) marked &quot;Quick Assistance,&quot; which allowed me to call a Microsoft support line, be greeted by &quot;Kathy,&quot; who with some instructions, enabled me to trash a few troublesome files and presto! I can drag-and-drop text again. Thanks, Steve Resnick!<br /><br />OK, we land. Progress to the shuttle bus at this airport, which is approximately the size of Massachusetts, arrive at car rental. No hybrids, no Garmins. Off I go in a car that doesn&#039;t use a key. A terrible light goes on. One I&#039;ve never seen before. I pull over, search the glove compartment in hopes of looking up the light problem, but there&#039;s only a CD in it. A CD. I return to rental place. Attendant gives me the &quot;boy, are you stupid, lady&quot; routine, says it&#039;s, of course, as everyone knows, the tire pressure light, then says he&#039;ll feel the tires for me (no comment) and that I should just ignore it because the tires are just fine. Now it&#039;s getting dark and I&#039;m watching the time and I&#039;m about to be late for the dinner so I take off. (He was right, I am stupid.)<br /><br />This is a city, if you can call a metropolis the size of, say, Dallas-Fort Worth a city, with no lights on their road signs. Or signs with the number of miles to the next destination. And no match between the printed maps and the number of miles apparently ahead.<br /><br />This post is getting too long. A purported 45-minute journey takes two hours. The exit numbers don&#039;t match the printed exit numbers - as in I am supposed to get off at 465E but the numbers are like, Exit 81 and 82. I end up on a one-way street with no exit other than the Chuck-E Cheese (is that how you even spell it?) parking lot. My room key (key, ha!) at the hotel doesn&#039;t work. My breakfast doesn&#039;t come via room service (&quot;there was a problem with your order so we didn&#039;t know what to do&quot; - uh, er, call me?). I can&#039;t get the trunk of the car open (remember, only a CD in the glove compartment).<br /><br />Skip to the event, which is great. Very nice people, good thinkers, and a wonderful time is had by all.<br /><br />Then I&#039;m leaving and ask the locals for directions back to the airport. &quot;Take 35 East. No, take 35 West. I don&#039;t know. You can take 35 East or West.&quot; Finally, it&#039;s decided I should take 35 West. I do. No problem other than it&#039;s growing dark again and I can&#039;t see the road signs and there are no signs to the airport until 1.5 miles before I get there. Arrive in about an hour&#039;s time at airport. Pull into car rental and am asked about car. The light is still on so I explain what happened. &quot;Well, *that&#039;s* not the tire light,&quot; says the attendant. &quot;Who told you that? You never should have been put in this car.&quot; Result = $40 credit.<br /><br />Then I get on the shuttle bus back to the terminal.<br /><br />Wrong bus. Turns out there are three American terminals. Silly me.<br /><br />Skytrain to proper terminal.<br /><br />Grab a sandwich.<br /><br />Get on plane.<br /><br />Have whole row to myself.<br /><br />Ah, the enchanting life of the consultant.<br /></div></div>

The photos begin with this one taken June 17,
2005, showing Dr G leaving the Neshoba County Court House in Philadelphia, Miss., with David. She was there to testify in the murder trial of Ku Klux Klansman Edgar Ray
Killen, accused in the 1964 killings of her
son, Andy, and two other civil rights workers (Michael Schwerner and James Chaney). Then read <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070818/NEWS/708180350/1001/news">this obit</a> by Jerry Mitchell, who kept this story alive for a very long time. Read more <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/SPECIAL17/60416008">here</a> about Mitchell's tireless investigative reporting that &quot;<span class="art_p_body">has unearthed documents, cajoled suspects and
witnesses, and quietly pursued evidence in the nation's notorious
killings from the civil rights era.&quot;</span></p>
<p>At the trial, Dr. G read <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">the postcard</a> that Andy mailed from Mississippi on the day he was killed.</p>
<p>Killen was convicted of &quot;<span class="art_p_body">orchestrating the killings,&quot; Mitchell writes, </span><span class="art_p_body">on the 41st anniversary of the young men's murders June 21, 1964, </span><span class="art_p_body">and is serving sixty years in prison for manslaughter.<br /><br />Mitchell's personal understanding of Dr G comes through in his piece, reflected in the quote he chose from her son:</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="art_p_body">Goodman’s son, David, said today: “Besides
being my mother, my mentor and spiritual guide, she taught me the
precious value of human dignity and the importance of speaking up and
acting whenever your own, your family’s or other people’s dignities and
civil rights are denied.”</span></p></blockquote><p>Other obits: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/17/AR2007081702093.html">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6858818,00.html">The Guardian</a>...just google.</p>

  <title>Bourne Betrayal rises to #9 on NY Times list!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keen readers know of my recent meeting with <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/come-with-me-me.html">Eric Lustbader</a>, who is hands-down the biggest poster to this blog (grazie). Glory, glory. NY Times Book Review, tomorrow, July 15, 2007 does a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/15tbr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">nice call out</a> to his <em>Bourne Betrayal </em>and gives Eric the space to explain how he's writing books about Robert Ludlum's characters. Interesting writing proposition, Eric, and what a great gift from Mr. Ludlum's family. Open to answering a coupla questions here? Now, I've put you on the spot.</p>
<p>Antiochian alert: Eric went to grammar school with Neelon (nee Pepper) Crawford, '69, married to Susan Hill, '70.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span class="bold">THE BOURNE RESURGENCY:</span> Robert Ludlum died in
2001, but his books keep coming. The new one, “Robert Ludlum’s The
Bourne Betrayal,” written by Eric Van Lustbader, rises this week to No.
9 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/bestseller/0715besthardfiction.html">fiction list</a>.
Van Lustbader, who also publishes thrillers under his own (excellent)
name, took over the Bourne franchise a few years ago. On his <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/index.asp">Web site</a>,
he notes that some people “still seem confused by my writing novels
about a character created by Robert Ludlum.” For anyone who is still
puzzled, here’s Van Lustbader’s stab at <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/news.asp">clearing everything up</a>:
“I was asked by the estate of the late Robert Ludlum to continue the
series Bob started. He wrote three Bourne novels (‘The Bourne
Identity,’ ‘The Bourne Supremacy,’ ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’). ... I have
so far written ‘The Bourne Legacy’ and ‘The Bourne Betrayal.’ These
books are written entirely by me from my own ideas, though some people
persist in thinking that I wrote them with Bob. This would be rather
difficult to do, since he’s dead. Also, he left no notes or unfinished
manuscripts pertaining to Jason Bourne. Are we clear now? Good!”</p></blockquote>

    <wp:comment_content>Aiming for the reasonable, Eric, as the intelligent may be beyond my ken but here goes:
Q?
A: [as in ask yourself the first question - dirty pool :)]
Q: In Agatha Christie's obit (don't remember where), she was quoted as saying she really wanted to be a concert pianist, not a mystery writer. You?
Q: You said you don't hang with writers cuz they're too similar to you. Who then? What varities?
Q: How are you working OrgScope into your new novel? A character with an OrgScope in her pocket?</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>I always wanted to be in a rock'n'roll band.  I spent 10 years in rock doing many other things (writing, producing, A&amp;amp;R, publicity, merchandising).  I was even on stage with a couple of bands I went on the road with (Elton John, Mountain -- but that's another story)-- but that's as far as I got.
Anyway, strange to say, it's too public a life for me. My getting up in front of people constantly wpould surely lead to a mental breakdown!
Tomorrow, next question answered. Tune in. (This is the Charles Dickins version of a Blog).</wp:comment_content>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of us living in the Greater Boston Globe area learned yesterday that the most familiar of sounds, the morning paper tossed into the driveway (or dropped on the front step or brushing our apartment doors) may soon be permanently silenced.</p><p>Yesterday&#039;s banner headline so stunned me that I couldn&#039;t even compose a post: &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/04/times_co_threatens_to_shut_globe_seeks_20m_in_cuts_from_unions/">Times Co. threatens to shut Globe; seeks $20m in cuts from unions</a>.&quot; Later that day, The Times columnist <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimeskristof">Nicholas Kristof</a> posted this update to Twitter: &quot;<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Who would have ever, ever imagined that the Boston Globe might not survive? It&#039;s a grim time for a journalist.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, very grim. When the NY Times Company bought the Boston Globe back in 1993, some forward thinkers feared what was then perceived as the worst: that The Times management would turn the Globe into a regional paper.<br /><br />And indeed not many years passed before that proved mostly true (though there remains, almost against all odds, some fantastic &quot;Global&quot; reporting going on). Foreign bureaus were closed and the non-New England news seemed to increasingly bear the label of a news service, often The New York Times News Service.<br /><br />Another yes: all print media are suffering <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/you-wont-miss-it-til-its-gone-rocky-mountain-news.html">yadda</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/speaking-of-newspapers-c-1989.html">yadda</a>. But as <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/02/cancel-your-newspaper-subscription-april-2043-no-sooner.html">others</a> are <a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2009/04/reach-out-and-open-up-globe.html">saying</a>, a newspaper is not just a business. It&#039;s a way to keep a society honest through investigative reporting, informed through plain old good journalism, and together through speaking with an unmistakable voice.<br /><br />There are ways to solve this, New York Times Company, that fall outside the traditional means, axing everything in sight or demolishing the whole thing. We&#039;ve already lost many of our best Boston reporters.<br /><br />Thinking caps on, please. Fast. Yesterday&#039;s story gives the unions 30 days to make concessions. Make that 29 days. The response to yesterday&#039;s news is reflected in <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/05/threat_to_globe_triggers_flood_of_feelings/">an article today</a> and in the hundreds of comments on the Globe site itself.</span></span></p><p>A lot more than a newspaper is at stake.<br /><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"></span></span></p><p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"><br /></span></span></p>

    <wp:comment_content>JBobb, I agree. 26 years is a long time to be in the news biz.
And, Jay, I agree that bailing out the newspaper industry might be a lot more worthy than banks and cars. Why hasn't anyone thought of that? Disposable, like the paper they're printed on???</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Are nonprofits less efficient?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend is having problems being paid for services rendered to a nonprofit. Conclusion? Don&#039;t work for nonprofits, right?</p><p>In my experience, ta-da: wrong.</p><p>Having submitted invoices to many entities over the years -- everything from mega-corporations to city governments to tiny nonprofits -- the record holder for difficulty in being paid belongs to the big companies.</p><p>Back in the late 1980s, when Digital Equipment Corporation was the major employer in the cosmos (exaggeration, merely the universe), we were having problems being paid. So I decided to do a flow chart of the process. It took 19 separate signoffs. Other consultants started calling me for advice on how to be paid by DEC.</p><p>I guess that explains why Digital went out of business. Howevuh...while some companies are very efficient, I&#039;ve found it equally difficult with other big firms. The invoice submission process is a fine art (or really bad art) with ridiculous quirks that make slow nonprofits look like comets in comparison. The most ridiculous? Having to send paper copies of invoices -- you know, that stuff over in the pile in your paperless office -- to global enterprises. And then being told the paper copy, sent by overnight delivery service, was never received because Accounts Payable &quot;never heard of&quot; the person who signed for it in their Receiving Dept.</p><p>Meanwhile, I hope my friend is paid soon.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://melindamoses.wordpress.com/about/">Melinda Meyer Moses</a>, I was able to attend the <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/index.php">MIT Sloan CIO Symposium</a> yesterday. Although I wasn&#039;t able to sit in for the whole day, I was able to catch a few excellent sessions, including the one on <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/agenda.php">virtual organizations</a> (you&#039;ll have to scroll to find it on the agenda) where <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/speakers.php#">Simon Crosby</a>, Citrix&#039;s CTO for Virtualization and Management, dropped quite a few gems.</p><p>Honestly, it&#039;s hard for anyone on a panel about virtual organizations to say anything new. Most people are operating from the limited base of their own experience - their company, for example, which was the case with most panelists. I should say &quot;is&quot; the case with most panelists. I&#039;ve been on a slew of such panels.</p><p>And, as is typical, regardless of the question, especially at a tech conference, which is where, say, 99.99% of these panels take place, the answer is almost always about technology, i.e. we use x, y, and z. Further, the only technologies referenced (again, typically) are the real-time things - teleconferencing, screen sharing, video - all useful, necessary, yadda yadda, but, in my experience, not what makes for profound breakthroughs in how we can work differently in a no-travel, post-meltdown, carbon-emission-intensive, whatever-the-name-of-the-next-flu-is world.</p><p>Yesterday&#039;s panel, with its earnest participants, was no exception, which is why Simon&#039;s remarks stood out. Good work, Simon.

It seems that STILL the more things change, the more they stay the same, eh? Whether it's a vendor delivering to a client, or a CIO/CTO delivering to their (internal) clients ...
Make it simple, make it safer, start small, get the right people together before you start, get a sponsor (although these days those sponsors might be in the head office or in the offices next to you), expect (and work through) the hiccups ...
So at the end of the day people can actually begin to work together, collaborating, innovating, focusing on the important things more and tending to the systems a bit less.
Focus on the teams first ...</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Advice to Hillary; thankfully never sent #imwithher</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have six things in common with Hillary. Both our husbands studied at Oxford where each lived at 46 Leckford Road, a house mine originally rented (and moved out of when hers moved in). We’re both 69 (I’m a few months older). We both loved the teen idol Fabian (I met him in person and he kissed me on the cheek). We both spoke at our college graduations (she was filmed; there’s merely a still photo of me). We both have worked all our adult lives. And we both are grandmothers.</p>
<p>When she was still thinking about running (or at least that was the public position), her first grandchild, Charlotte, was born. I felt impelled to give advice about her impending political decision, which in a moment for me of “the world [being] too much with us,” was simply this: Don’t. My argument against her running for president was based on my (and many others’) opinion and experience as to where the deepest satisfactions in life originate—in accomplishments or in love. They shouldn’t be such binary choices but for women they are.</p>
<p>I never sent the advice or published the piece; she ran; and now we’re in the range of double-digit hours until we know whether indeed she will be the next/first-woman/first-former-First-Lady President of this continuous experiment in democracy called the United States of America.</p>
<p>For her sake, I wish she hadn’t run. Far and away the most abusive campaign in our history; far and away the most shocking, so appalling&#160;in its turns that we writers find ourselves saying that a novel following the plot of this election would never find a publisher due to its unbelievability; and far and away the most dangerous for what it could mean if she does not win (not to mention mounting fears if she does, c.f., the threats of armed insurrection).</p>
<p>For her sake, I wish I’d sent this advice and that she’d followed it, which my fourth-generation feminist daughters were shocked to see coming from this granddaughter of a suffragist (she marched until 1920), born to a feminist mother (who didn&#039;t change her name when first married and always worked outside the home), I, who was lucky enough to turn 21 in 1968 at the height of the second-wave of feminism, which I embraced.</p>
<p>But for our sake, I’m very glad she ran. Her example is straightening the spines of little girls, young women, and even women my age; her grit is as incomparable as any of our peers, male or female; her ability to think of her feet is as good as anyone’s; and her skill at throwing off the insults, dismissals, and now the very threats to her life is, how do I say this, incredible.</p>
<p>Having followed&#160;her more closely these past two years, I’m betting that she’s found a way to take those calls from Chelsea anyway (see below).</p>
<p><strong>And I’m sure she’s going to win.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote--but never sent--on September 24, 2014:</p>
<p><em>Rock, Grandma, Don’t Run</em></p>
<p>In the constellation of unwelcome advice, none is less desirable than re: family. Young mothers are the unwitting recipients of bounteous bromides as per the passerby, who, touching your baby, which, first of all, why are you touching my baby, catalogues a registry of rebukes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t you think you should have a hat on her?</li>
<li>Why are you feeding him avocado?</li>
<li>Shouldn’t she be in bed by now?</li>
<li>What? She’s in your bed?</li>
<li>You changed him where? On the hood of your car?</li>
<li>Your three-year-old still has a bottle?</li>
<li>Your four-year-old boy wears pink?</li>
<li>Your five-year-old girl refuses to wear pink?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s endless and annoying and so, with this in mind, I offer the following unsolicited advice to a friend of a friend, a woman I have never met, one so famous that she’s in the single-name league of Madonna and Beyoncé, the rock star of politics and world’s most famous new grandmother, Hillary.</p>
<p>“I’m baaaack,” you sang to the steak-fry crowd in Iowa. ReadyforHillary—not to mention 656 pages of <em>Hard Choices</em>—seems to answer the question of whether you’re running. But all of that was pre-Charlotte.</p>
<p>Today you are now like me (sorta kinda: mine had preemie twins; no one can spell my last name while yours is all but a verb), Hillary, grandmother to the child of your daughter, who is setting off into the rainforest of parenting—unexpected showers, strange storms of illness, odd creatures (which is how first-time parents often feel about their quirky newborns)—with abundant resources but no experience, because you are not a mom or dad until you really are one.</p>
<p>Until you’ve done it a hundred times, you don’t really know how to change a diaper without really waking up, or how to swaddle a baby, or whether to call the doctor for the millionth time because this one might really be the really real thing and what if you don’t, who knows, your baby might be really dead before they call back?</p>
<p>Your daughter will be a natural, of course, because that’s what we all say—and feel— about our daughters because in the end it is a very natural human thing to give birth—i.e. how could 100 billion have made it out of the womb in the past 50,000 years unless it were relatively ordinary? But the data is incontrovertible: until you’ve done it, you don’t know jack—or Charlotte.</p>
<p>Which is why your daughter will be calling you every twenty minutes or so for the next several years, asking you questions that begin, “Did I…” at which point you will spiral down into The Abyss of Guilt Just Over the Cliff of Forgotten Memories. I’m sure you, unlike me, kept a daily baby book recording every one of your daughter’s projectile vomits and major accomplishments: first time sleeping more than two consecutive hours, first time unclenching her fists, first time rolling over. And you, being a strong global figure and role model extraordinaire, won’t be hurt when she yells at you for not remembering.</p>
<p>Even with a staff to help her because what new mother doesn’t need an overnight baby nurse, a daytime nanny, a cook, a housekeeper, and a personal secretary (if only! if only!), she will still need one particular person who can’t be hired: you.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the point of this unsolicited advice: You need not to miss this. You need not to miss the tiny advances, the first time Baby Charlotte does this, that, and the other thing, the first time your back aches from holding her because nothing hurts so good.</p>
<p>Yes, you can be president of the most powerful country the world has ever known. Yes, you can sit at the big desk and put Putin in his place. Yes, you can out-Kissinger Kissinger but you won’t be there for those first kisses. Might it be a tad awkward as president to take Baby Charlotte’s first phone call, which is not that long from now because just as you can’t comprehend that your baby has just had a baby, you will not believe how quickly the little twitchling goes from blob to blogger, if you’re in the Situation Room watching ISIS cowards being taken out?</p>
<p>Trust me: I want a woman in The White House. And I want you to have the same freedom to make the choice to run that your husband had. You do. And if that’s what you choose, you’ll probably win but what you’ll lose may well&#160;be&#160;far more profound.</p>
<p>Rock that baby, Hillary. Don’t run. It will make you all much happier.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks, again, to Matt Richtel for the excellent reporting on the dangers of driving while talking. Yesterday, the second-in-two-days Page One headline in The New York Times: &quot;<a href="http://www.mydeo.com/videorequest.asp?XID=11977&amp;CID=171174">Driven to Distraction: US Withheld Data on Risks of Distracted Driving</a>.&quot;</p><p>I don&#039;t need to go into more detail than this: The US government has had the data proving that it&#039;s extremely dangerous--akin to being drunk--to yabber on the phone while driving since 2003. Hands free or not. Makes no difference.</p><p>Richtel has done a superb job of following the timeline, putting together the salient facts, and pointing fingers in the right direction.</p><p>We all have stories to tell about the risks; I&#039;ve been <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/cell-phones/">posting mine</a> as regular readers know. And I&#039;ve come to the sorry conclusion that the person who <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/07/look-both-ways-before.html">sideswiped me</a> in Brooklyn last week was likely on the phone.</p><p>Here are a few blood-boiling paragraphs from Richtel&#039;s fury-maker:</p><blockquote><p>The former head of the highway safety agency said he was urged to
withhold the research to avoid antagonizing members of Congress who had
warned the agency to stick to its mission of gathering safety data but
not to lobby states.</p><p>Critics say that rationale and the failure
of the Transportation Department, which oversees the highway agency, to
more vigorously pursue distracted driving has cost lives and allowed to
blossom a culture of behind-the-wheel multitasking.</p><p>“We’re
looking at a problem that could be as bad as drunk driving, and the
government has covered it up,” said Clarence Ditlow, director of the
Center for Auto Safety. </p></blockquote><p>It took filing under the Freedom of Information Act, by the way, to force the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to release the report.</p><p>Now I&#039;m asking readers to leave a comment if you&#039;ve given up the deadly habit.</p>

  <title>Harvest Soup inspired by Daniel Bruce</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And now, by popular request, this recipe.</p>
<p>First came in contact with the basis for this soup when daughter Miranda (<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/recipes/recipes.html">her fine recipes</a>) took a semester away from college to earn her <a href="http://www.bu.edu/foodandwine/culinary/">certificate in culinary arts at Boston University</a>, highly recommended 14-week program. Each week, the public was invited to lectures with famous chefs (yes, I sat a few feet from Jacques Pepin, among others) as they cooked. A few times we were invited to actually cook with them. My big catch? <a href="http://www.bostonchefs.com/clients/Meritage/chef_page/">Daniel Bruce</a>, chef extraordinaire at the Boston Harbor Hotel, leading to my first and last time cooking fois gras.&nbsp; Bruce is the generator of the original recipe for the soup below that I’ve altered a bit. Thanks, Daniel, for the now heavily-stained printout of your menu/recipe list, “Autumn in New England: A Festive Dinner with Daniel Bruce, Wednesday, October 15, 1997.”</p>
<p>Harvest Soup (serves 12)</p>
<p>Basic Soup:<br />4 oz butter<br />1 large sweet onion (Spanish, vidalia)<br />3-1/4 c carrots (4 or 5, depending on size)<br />3-1/4 c rutabaga (large-it’s in the turnip family)<br />3-1/4 c butternut squash (buy cut up if possible)<br />4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />8 c chicken or vegetable stock (I use veg)<br />4 cloves smashed garlic<br />4 leaves fresh sage<br />healthy amount of peppercorns (10-12)<br />kosher (large grain) salt to your liking</p>
<p>Garnish:<br />1 c cheddar cheese (grated)<br />1/3 c toasted walnuts (or butternuts if you can find them)<br />1/4 c fresh thyme (remove leaves from stems)<br />3/4 c rutabaga (dice and steam)<br />3/4 c butternut squash (dice and steam)</p>
<p>1. Cut all veggies for soup into 2 inch chunks.</p>
<p>2. Melt butter in large skillet or soup pan. Add onions, garlic, rutabaga, and carrots and cook over medium heat until onions glisten (about 10 mins). Add squash, stock, thyme and sage (herbs tied for easy removal). Simmer until veggies are soft (20-30 mins, depending on size of your chunks).</p>
<p>3. Remove herbs. Puree in blender until smooth as silk. Return to heat. Stir in half-and-half and season to taste.</p>
<p>4. Put garnish in soup bowl and ladle soup over (or vice-versa). Can add chopped chives.</p>
<p><em>Can make this ahead and freeze. Also feel free to add parsnips, my fave soup veg, for extra sweetness.</em></p>

    <wp:comment_content>I'm looking forward to watching the panel unfold via Twitter - would be cool if y'all could add to the online conversation while there.
Too much to ask?

    <wp:comment_content>Thankyou,
I've been so lucky to attend your session. And your work like a moderator is great.
Your panel gave me some good idea in how to increase my "corporate" blogging levels.
I learned lot.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#039;m having <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/03/ok-i-goofed---i.html">trouble with Verizon</a> again. 85th call. I&#039;m exaggerating. 75th.</p><p>Simple stuff. I&#039;m asking for repairs for the fact that:</p><p>1. I can&#039;t retrieve my voicemail; and<br />2. A line that&#039;s rolled over to another for 25 years suddenly has stopped &quot;hunting.&quot;</p><p>In the course of trying to straighten this out:</p><ul>
<li>I&#039;ve been told three times that I placed an order for the lines to be disconnected;</li>
<li>I&#039;ve been told the line WAS disconnected, the very line I was calling them on;</li>
<li>I&#039;ve been transferred to the technician&#039;s (not technical) support line where I could receive assistance for installing a T1 line or a &quot;pod;&quot; and</li>
<li>Finally, in the Bizarre Telephone Transfer of the year, I WAS JUST TRANSFERRED BY <strong>VERIZON TECHNICAL SUPPORT</strong> TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CENTER FOR GAS LEAKS, a division of Amerigas, the gas company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for the screaming. Does anyone have a tin can and a string available? </p>

    <wp:comment_content>Oh .. a topic so dear to my heart ...
Here's my recurring fantasy ...
I'm giving a presentation about interacting with customers in an auditorium with THOUSANDS Of people.
At the beginning of my talk, I call the Verizon technical support line and put the phone on speaker.
Several times during my six hour talk, I actually GET someone on the line who provides zero help and transfers me somewhere else where again we'll be hearing the musak on background while I continue my talk ...
I am able to illustrate every single point of my talk by a BAD example of same happening live online on the Verizon technical support line ..
I conduct one of my standard audience participation exercises where they are asked to turn to their neighbor and tell their own worst horror story of experience with Verizon ...
The BUZZ is palpable as everyone plays "can you top this"
An executive from Verizon is in the audience ...</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Rules for Second Life</title>
  <link>https://kgnomad.wordpress.com/2007/07/27/rules-for-secon/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know what Second Life is, then this post's title makes sense -- and that would be 8 million of you (a mere fraction of my readers, of course). And if you've never heard of it, <a href="http://secondlife.com/">take a look</a>: In short, it's an online environment where you can buy virtual land, visit virtual places, make virtual friends, and, in the past couple of years, conduct meetings, go to concerts, even listen to candidates hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Turns out that a bunch of biggies, including IBM, have been scooping up virtual real estate and building their own online environments. We did a quick survey of what's out there for a client last year and were surprised to find how many companies are playing with this technology.</p>
<p>Ever the experimenter, I joined and spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get my bearings and figure out how to &quot;fit in.&quot; Having never played a video game beyond Frogger (oh, for those innocent days), I was a clumsy Second Lifer. Mainly, I felt like a rube. The &quot;clothing&quot; that comes with signing on left me feeling a lot like my grandmother must have when she stepped off the boat from Rotterdam onto Ellis Island. The previous immigrants had hip, imaginative appearances. I was from the Old Country.</p>
<p>But, alas, it's a generous world and a &quot;woman&quot; (she could have been a hermaphrodite, no way to tell, but her avatar was a woman) from Denmark (or Mars, again...) sent me a text message, offering me some hand-me-downs. Quickly, I looked a bit more like a native.</p>
<p>OK, back to The Rules. IBM has issued <a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html">some guidelines</a> for its 5000 virtual employees. Well, I guess they're actual employees participating virtually. From Rachel Konrad's article and with thanks to Eric Bedell's superb <a href="http://thiswebday.com/">This Web Day</a> for the pointer (hi, Eric!):</p><blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span></span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><p>
IBM's rules - which apply to &quot;Second Life,&quot;&quot;Entropia
Universe,&quot;&quot;Forterra,&quot; There.com and other worlds - are logical
extensions of the real world: Don't discuss intellectual property with
unauthorized people. Don't discriminate or harass.</p>
<p>
Guidelines also include a 21st-century version of the Golden Rule: &quot;Be a good 3D Netizen.&quot;</p>
<p>
Other rules are unique to the metaverse, which requires users to create
animated avatars with distinct appearances, personalities and gestures.
&quot;Second Life,&quot; owned by San Francisco-based Linden Lab, has more than 8
million avatars; most look human, but many take the form of chipmunks,
zombies or fantastic beasts.</p>
<p>
IBM, whose 20th century employees were parodied as corporate cogs in
matching navy suits, doesn't have an avatar dress code. But guidelines
suggest being &quot;especially sensitive to the appropriateness of your
avatar or persona's appearance when you are meeting with IBM clients or
conducting IBM business.&quot;</p>
<p>
Rules caution workers who have multiple avatars or frequently change
their avatar's appearance. It's common to have numerous avatars -
similar to having multiple <a target="_blank" href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html#" class="iAs" style="border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent;padding-bottom: 1px">e-mail</a> addresses for work and personal use.</p>
<p>
&quot;Building a reputation of trust within a virtual world represents a
commitment to be truthful and accountable with fellow digital

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Readers in the US probably have some idea of what the last hours of the election look like but, for those abroad, I offer this view as reported by Eyewitness-to-History-and-Daughter-#1 late last night:</em></p><p>We had a great time canvassing for Obama in Bethlehem, PA, this weekend.&#160; As we heard many times while there, Pennsylvania will be won or lost in Lehigh Valley, which is where we spent our time going door-to-door. Philly and Pittsburgh will go for Obama, most of the center of the state will be McCain, so Lehigh Valley is one of the few counties &quot;in play&quot; in PA.&#160; Our adventure included lots of old-fashioned pounding the pavement.&#160; I will never look at people who come door-to-door the same way again :).&#160; It was an exciting time, but it is going to be close.&#160; It was amazing how divided areas could be.&#160;&#160; We would be on one street covered with Obama signs and the next would be all McCain and then, one street farther over, the signs would alternate all the way down the block. </p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4c51970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="IMG_0021" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4c51970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842715.jpg" /></a>
<br /></div><p><br />Voters in these &quot;battlegrounds&quot; truly have a completely different view of the election.&#160; Many voters have been visited in person every weekend for the past couple of months by the Obama campaign - each time with a different purpose, although the same underlying message... The organization on the ground was also very impressive.&#160; One of the organizers was telling us that every morning they get new and very specific instructions of what to do on that particular day.&#160; Despite the large number of volunteers descending on the campaign this weekend, we were always given our instructions within 5 minutes of walking through the door.</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010535d484be970c-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="IMG_0034" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010535d484be970c " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842718.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br /></div><p>One of the field organizers we met explained that they had opened the Obama office during the primaries on Main Street in Bethlehem.&#160; It was a prime downtown location and gave them lots of great visibility.&#160; When the primaries were over the campaign pulled out, but the local grassroots organizers felt that it was really important to keep the location open.&#160; They raised money, collected donations, and worked extra shifts from April until August to keep the office until the national campaign came back because they felt that it was strategically important.&#160; It was so exciting to hear the level of commitment that a lot of these volunteers have to the campaign.</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4d34970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="IMG_0035" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4d34970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842720.jpg" /></a>
<br /></div><p><br />We also had a fun experience this afternoon.&#160; We heard that <a href="http://cdn.dayport.com/wfmzimg/htm/DayPortWFMZPlayer.html?articleID=568834&amp;limit=10&amp;isSpanish=false&amp;adInsertionInterval=2&amp;bannerAdConDefID=8&amp;defaultPreviewImage=http%3A//wfmzimg.dayport.com/img/icons/PlayerThumbnail.jpg&amp;domain=wfmz.dayport.com&amp;imageDomain=cdn.dayport.com/wfmzimg&amp;limit_default=10&amp;conDefID=2&amp;videoAdObjectID=4&amp;logoAdObjDefID=5&amp;siteName=WFMZ%20TV&amp;callLetters=WFMZ&amp;version=20070627">Caroline Kennedy would be speaking </a>at the Bethlehem headquarters.&#160; We decided to head over to see what was happening before heading back to New York.&#160; The rally turned out to be 20 times (!!) the size that they were expecting, so they moved it to a local park.&#160; It was cool to be part of one of those campaign-type events and Caroline Kennedy certainly had some interesting comparisons to draw between her father&#039;s campaign and Obama&#039;s.</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4dc2970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="IMG_0049" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010535ce4dc2970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842722.jpg" /></a>
<br /></div><p><br />I realized I wouldn&#039;t be able to focus at work on Tuesday, so Liza [Daughter #2] and I will be headed back to PA for election day to get out the vote.&#160; They told us they will be following up with some voters up to 5 times on Tuesday to try to make sure they make it to the polls - wow!&#160; Fingers crossed for Tuesday!!!&#160; </p><p>Here are some shots from our adventure!</p><p>Love, Mirm</p><div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d08834010535d4855e970c-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="IMG_0041_2" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834010535d4855e970c " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842724.jpg" /></a>

  <title>Message to other consultants about BP disaster</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p><p>Many of us have worked with BP (we did one small project for its-then Organizational Engineering group in 1993, thanks to Lilly Evans).</p><p>Many more of us have pointed to some great examples at BP, like its early start in knowledge management, communities of practice, and its unusual organization designs.</p><p>Now BP is at the heart of a colossal safety failure that killed eleven people, seriously injured many more, and which threatens the entire Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Those of us in consulting spend so much time talking about communication and organization and so many other terms that I first listed them here then deleted them all because the stream together sounds like so much gobbledygook.</p><p> Although it will take time to determine everything that went wrong
(here&#039;s an excellent piece by Forbes blogger Christopher Helman, &quot;<a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/energysource/2010/04/30/bps-deepwater-disaster-what-happened-and-why/">BP&#039;s
Deepwater Disaster: What Happened and Why?</a>&quot;, who suggests, among
other reasons, a decision-making call that may have been in part to
blame), this horrific incident offers both a practice field for
prevention and a readiness plan for the next time something like this
happens.</p><p>What advice can we, brilliant consultants of the world, offer BP and the US government right now--and offer to future BP-like disasters? No one in this catastrophe may ever hear what we have to say but every disaster (Haiti was barely 14 weeks ago) cries out for better collaboration, faster knowledge exchange, greater innovation. </p><p>I posted <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2010/04/did-wholesale-flattening-contribute-to-bp-gulf-disaster.html">an initial thought yesterday</a>. Yours?</p><p></p>

<hr style="margin: 2em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ddd;"/><div class="legacy-comments" style="background-color:#f8f9fa; padding:1.5em; border-radius:6px;"><h4 style="color:#666;">Comments from Original Post</h4><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Just Oilfield Trash <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— May 01, 2010 at 03:54 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Here&#x27;s a novel idea - talk to (and more importantly, LISTEN to) the guys actually on the rig who are doing the work. No one is more motivated to perform each job safely than the guys who risk their lives every day on these rigs.<br/>If a guy on the rig tells his rig supervisor there&#x27;s a problem, the rig supervisor has got to have the support by management in the offices to back him up on his decisions. It&#x27;s critical that the rig crew and the rig supervisor has the authority to respond immediately to dangerous situations without their hands being held behind their back while corporate deliberates and makes an official decision.<br/>The oil industry has so many layers of management and corporate repercussions that an environment has been fostered where the rig crew is afraid or unable to respond with instinct when a situation may lead to a catastrophic event. Corporate needs to rely on their judgment and expertise.<br/>Have you ever read an instruction manual, but when you actually did the assembly project you realized things needed to be tweaked as you went along because the manual doesn&#x27;t cover every possibility?<br/>This happens every day on the rig. You&#x27;ve got engineers sitting in an office who have never set foot on a rig or hands-on worked with a variety of chemicals in a volatile high pressure environment. Yet these are the guys who are consulting their reports and their charts and their graphs and dictating what needs to be done - and admonishing the rig personnel who might raise objections to their orders. If rig personnel point out red flags, corporate needs to LISTEN.<br/>Bottom line is, if something goes wrong with an engineer&#x27;s calculation - that engineer will still be able to drive home to his family at the end of the day. And with the Deepwater Horizon rig there are 11 hardworking men who will never return home. Who has a more vested interest in rig safety, a guy in an office or the guy on a rig? You tell me.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Jessica Lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— May 01, 2010 at 04:14 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Another wise response, JOT. Thanks for taking the time to make this case. How does authority work among all the companies on the rig?</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Gil ad Ariely <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— May 01, 2010 at 04:54 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Jessica<br/>Following your question, three initial thoughts- relating to managing knowledge, and this horrendous event:<br/>For now emphasis should be on emergency response and aftermath – and there is much to be said for Operational KM contribution, but usually only if prepared for in advance. The Haiti response included some real time innovative initiatives, to share emerging knowledge in real time and support the relief efforts.<br/>Secondly- since I respect knowledge, and I know nothing of this, I would wait patiently for (and hope) that proper AAR is done in a learning manner (rather than beheading per se). This is a KM feature too.<br/>Last but not least – responding to your unpublished piece on flattening BP, efficiency vs effectiveness etc. – couldn’t agree more (in principle), and have seen Hammer and Champy being abused to reengineer enough damage, letting go some of the key tacit knowledge. I cannot say though if that is the case – as I have not consulted for BP (which is a pity, at least for me, since it is a fascinating organization).<br/>Regards,<br/>Gil</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Jessica Lipnack <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— May 01, 2010 at 05:29 PM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Thanks, Gil. Very good info here.</div></div><hr style="margin:1.5em 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;"/><div style="margin-top:1.25em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">George Kimball <span style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">— May 03, 2010 at 02:55 AM</span></div><div style="color:#444; margin-top:0.25em;">Jessica, as you undoubtedly know in your dna at this point, the real issue is who has power in an organization, almost regardless of what organization - four people deciding where to go for lunch faces this issue.<br/>I suppose it is inevitable that people want power and the prestige that goes with it (dogs are no different). Many will get it by stripping those lower down of influence. Consequently, it is difficult or even in some sense unnatural, to push responsibility downward. My own observation is that it requires a manager who is both quite mature and secure to do so.<br/>If you look at organizations where there must be real power at the bottom levels - here, on the platform itself - they almost always are in turmoil because of this.

    <wp:comment_content>Here's a novel idea - talk to (and more importantly, LISTEN to) the guys actually on the rig who are doing the work. No one is more motivated to perform each job safely than the guys who risk their lives every day on these rigs.
If a guy on the rig tells his rig supervisor there's a problem, the rig supervisor has got to have the support by management in the offices to back him up on his decisions. It's critical that the rig crew and the rig supervisor has the authority to respond immediately to dangerous situations without their hands being held behind their back while corporate deliberates and makes an official decision.
The oil industry has so many layers of management and corporate repercussions that an environment has been fostered where the rig crew is afraid or unable to respond with instinct when a situation may lead to a catastrophic event. Corporate needs to rely on their judgment and expertise.
Have you ever read an instruction manual, but when you actually did the assembly project you realized things needed to be tweaked as you went along because the manual doesn't cover every possibility?
This happens every day on the rig. You've got engineers sitting in an office who have never set foot on a rig or hands-on worked with a variety of chemicals in a volatile high pressure environment. Yet these are the guys who are consulting their reports and their charts and their graphs and dictating what needs to be done - and admonishing the rig personnel who might raise objections to their orders. If rig personnel point out red flags, corporate needs to LISTEN.
Bottom line is, if something goes wrong with an engineer's calculation - that engineer will still be able to drive home to his family at the end of the day. And with the Deepwater Horizon rig there are 11 hardworking men who will never return home. Who has a more vested interest in rig safety, a guy in an office or the guy on a rig? You tell me.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica
Following your question, three initial thoughts- relating to managing knowledge, and this horrendous event:
For now emphasis should be on emergency response and aftermath – and there is much to be said for Operational KM contribution, but usually only if prepared for in advance. The Haiti response included some real time innovative initiatives, to share emerging knowledge in real time and support the relief efforts.
Secondly- since I respect knowledge, and I know nothing of this, I would wait patiently for (and hope) that proper AAR is done in a learning manner (rather than beheading per se). This is a KM feature too.
Last but not least – responding to your unpublished piece on flattening BP, efficiency vs effectiveness etc. – couldn’t agree more (in principle), and have seen Hammer and Champy being abused to reengineer enough damage, letting go some of the key tacit knowledge. I cannot say though if that is the case – as I have not consulted for BP (which is a pity, at least for me, since it is a fascinating organization).

Gil</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica, as you undoubtedly know in your dna at this point, the real issue is who has power in an organization, almost regardless of what organization - four people deciding where to go for lunch faces this issue.
I suppose it is inevitable that people want power and the prestige that goes with it (dogs are no different). Many will get it by stripping those lower down of influence. Consequently, it is difficult or even in some sense unnatural, to push responsibility downward. My own observation is that it requires a manager who is both quite mature and secure to do so.
If you look at organizations where there must be real power at the bottom levels - here, on the platform itself - they almost always are in turmoil because of this. As an engineer, I saw it many, many times, saw the incredible waste it creates, and saw the futility of trying to change it.
To give an example, tech employees have specialized knowledge that can change allocation of resources - power at the bottom. Everything above them resists it - managers don't want to show ignorance or weakness, financial types always deeply distrust engineers - and so forth.
A better example is showbiz, especially movies. Some performer of the thousands trying becomes 'hot', rising in popularity, which translates to ticket sales - controlled by the performer. Contracts get ignored or rewritten, actors dump the agents who made them successful, murderous politics erupt over control of a hit, and so on and on and on.
How does a well run organization deal with something innately contradictory and dysfunctional? Usually by neither seeing it nor dealing with it, to its own detriment. Even when perceived accurately, solutions are scant and often temporary, e.g. 'skunk works'.
So, Ms. Linack, how can one deal with a serious source of dysfunction tha has such deep emotional, behavioral and cultural roots? You can talk 'communication' and 'empowerment' all week - but that still doesn't get to the root.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wait, there's more. A bit stunned that I'm flogging Vanity Fair's July '07 issue again, I read on and have to relay this: There are also worthy reads on Jeffrey Sach's approach to economic development in Uganda, the effective use of anti-retrovirals, and a music festival in the Sahara, snapshots of 20-some inspiring leaders a la Mandela and the Ivory Coast Soccer Team, and ... because it is, in the end, Vanity Fair, Tina Brown on Princess Diana's &quot;love that got away.&quot; </p>

    <wp:comment_content>Dear Jess, I looked at your web
site  - and the section on Current Affairs - since I have no blog to write on - I wondered
if you  noted that tiny blurb in
the Globe a couple of days ago
which came from the NY Times - and said that something like $282,000,000. in US dollars had
been stolen from an Iraqi bank
either by Iraqui security guards or ?  I was totally
outraged, thinking of all the
underfunded and sagging US programs, ie. Soc. Security,
the environment cleanup and a
host of others that could have
been funded by our tax payer
dollars which were stolen.  Is
that part of the "progress in
Iraq touted by Bush and ilk?
Why wasn't this a huge headline?  See if anyone else
noted this little known fact.
It's probably the heat that's
making me sour about all these
things.  On a funny note, I
was cleaning out a bureau in
the attic for Kate to take and
I came across a print that I
had done in art school.  It was
an abstract design and I had
included the following sentence
in large letters:  Do You Think
God is Dead?  I thought of
presenting it to Ron on Wed.
pm?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was after dinner on Christmas night and I had a hankering for my daughters' (plural as they both make the best) chocolate chip cookies. <a href="http://turkeynose.com">Miranda</a> rose to the challenge, literally, and the result was this delicious concoction with just a tinge of red for the holiday.</p>
<p>Big baking advice: do not overcook. It ruins them. I was on oven duty and set the timer for the first batch at 9 minutes; for the second, 9 minutes 15 seconds. Ten mins max or you'll have biscotti not cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Night (Red) Chippers</strong></p>
<p>2 sticks butter<br />1 c brown sugar (light)<br />1/2 c granulated sugar (the normal terrible-for-you white kind)</p>
<p>2 c flour<br />1 t baking soda<br />1-1/2 t salt<br />1-1/2 t vanilla (get the real stuff, not the artificial flavoring kind)</p>
<p>1/4 c dried cranberries (chopped - keep these on hand, great snack)<br />1/4 walnuts or pecans (chopped - we keep jars of these on the counter for snacks)<br />1 c chocolate chips (dark preferred - the ones we used were 54% organic chocolate)<br />1/4 c cocoa</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375. Line cookie sheet with parchment (or silpat sheets). Scoop balls of cookie dough onto sheet, three across, three or four down, depending on size of the sheet. Don't put scoops too close together or they'll run together into cookie-cakes. Bake 9-10 minutes max. Remove when they look nearly done...but not quite. Allow to cool for 5 mins. Take a big plate into the room where everyone else is sitting and watch them disappear.</p>

  <title>The virtual 48 hours</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, so I literally never thought of this when I signed the contract. Happily asked to consult to a prestigious educational institution on the design of its new course on virtual teams. My role on the team of eight is &quot;subject matter expert,&quot; which basically means I'm supplying the content (in point of fact, NetAge signed the contract and I'm the NetAge person working on supplying NetAge content, just to be absolutely clear).</p>
<p>There's a short window for pulling all this together, which means they want fast turnaround when the &quot;developer&quot; or the &quot;instructional designer&quot; or the &quot;portfolio manager&quot; or the &quot;graphic designer&quot; or the &quot;project manager&quot; (you get the idea, team of 8) needs help. No problem, I thought. I'm quick, am generally accessible online (ask my family or my addiction counselor - jussst kidding), and what could happen that would take me out of a 48-hour response time?</p>
<p>However, just to be safe, I specified in the contract that there were certain periods when this provision would not apply, times when I know I'm traveling in the months to come.</p>
<p>Then yesterday morning, Sunday that is, I got my first request for info, which is the majority of the material I have to submit. Pages and pages, way too much for even Ms. Speedy Fingers to return in 48 hours even if I didn't already have a full plate and several other deadlines looming.</p>
<p>Got me thinking about what I hadn't considered before signing the contract: When does the 48-hour clock start ticking in the virtual world? When the email is sent to me? When I open it? When I respond? Do weekends count? Holidays? Emails sent at 11 at night or 3 in the morning (yes, I've received such from other clients, especially those on different clocks altogether)? What if it's sent from tomorrow (someone in New Zealand, for example)?</p>
<p>Anyone else had to think about this? I've suggested that we include this dilemma in the course itself. And just for the record, the developer understands completely and is not expecting anything unreasonable from me. </p>

    <wp:comment_content>Boy do i resonate with this one ...
Here's one of the things I've tried that works for us ..
In the contract (or in the project plan) i specify that there are different turn around times depending on whether it's something we can SCHEDULE or if it's something that comes up on the fly.
So, for example, if we all know that there is a date where we'd like to "go live" with whatever it is - then I can say "If you give us all the stuff by Specific Date then we can do it in 48 hours from that date" (or whatever is appropriate) because we will plan for it in our work schedule.   If something unplanned or unanticipated comes along (which is guaranteed to happen) we will prioritize based on what else is going on and we will tell you when we can commit to getting it done so you can plan.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/10/bitss-and-bytes-faster-slow-food.html" target="_self">Mark</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2011/01/goodbye-hello-mark.html" target="_self">Bittman</a>. Just in case there&#039;s any confusion, I don&#039;t know him.</p>
<p>But his practical, flexitarian, a word I hereby proclaim he invented (I have no idea and a quick search isn&#039;t giving me first use), approach to eating is the one I favor. I used to call myself an omnivore but I&#039;m not. Case in point: In Japan during one of those marathon dinners (first this restaurant, then that restaurant, then then...), I was offered whale. The year was 1989 so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still on anyone&#039;s menu/legal but the hosts were offering a great delicacy and I was appalled. I tried turning it down by saying it was against my religion to eat it. They asked my religion. I said networking.</p>
<p>To prove that I eat (almost) anything (and because I&#039;ve been hankering to post it), I submit this photo from a lunch we recently served while on vacation in one of the great eating fields of the world. Guess where.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mt_imported_image_1757841057.jpg"><img alt="Lunch in Crain" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00df3523b1d08834019b004591a2970d" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mt_imported_image_1757841056.jpg" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Lunch in Crain" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>It&#039;s a long way from Bittman&#039;s article in yesterday&#039;s The NY Times, &quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/dining/deep-fried-and-good-for-you.html?hpw&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Deep Fried and Good For You</a>,&quot; about the glories of fried food. I LOVE fried chicken and fried (not baked) falafel. Not to mention french fries (what my mother called frech frieds, quite deliberately, the English teacher) and clams and calamari and veggies... You get the picture.</p>
<p>Thus I was thrilled to receive this pass from Bittman yesterday. Here&#039;s the close, which is worth reading through to just in case you&#039;re willing to admit you love fried food too. (There are several recipes with the article as well.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Take it slow and either eat the food as it comes out of the fat (you can drain on paper towels or, if you want to be fancy, a cloth napkin) or keep it warm for as little time as possible in a low oven. Myself, I like to fry when people are standing around eating the food as fast as I can produce it; that is really fun. And good for you.</p>

[Photo by&nbsp; Paul Garber, courtesy, Muir Heritage Land Trust]<br /><br />I'm always amazed at how committed and creative people are when pursuing their passions. Here's a great example of a grassroots (look at the picture) networking effort that's literally transforming the landscape. The fine folks organized by the <a href="http://ridgetrail.org/">Bay Area Ridge Trail</a> are nearing completion of the 400th mile of trail around San Francisco Bay--for horse riding, biking, and hiking. On the weekend of June 2-3, 250 volunteers turned out&nbsp; to complete the trail through&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.6em"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Muir Heritage Land Trust’s Sky Ranch in Martinez, California. Thanks to Morris Older who edits the <a href="http://twha.org/">Tilden-Wildcat Horsemen's Association</a> Newsletter for all his hard work and for the tip. (Disclosure: he's my cousin.)<span style="font-size: 0.8em">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 0.6em"></span><span style="font-size: 0.6em">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 0.6em">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;font-size: 10pt">This is a request for information: I&#039;m looking for examples of how companies, nonprofits, and NGOs (even government agencies) implement their flexible work policies. Also known as virtual/distributed/agile/collaborative work approaches, these guidelines can cover everything from carpooling to work-from-home to hoteling to who-knows-what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva">I&#039;m gathering this info for <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2013/01/restorative-justice-with-the-dialogue-project.html" target="_self">a talk I&#039;m giving</a> for a global company--virtually, of course--at the end of the
month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva">Which companies have the most innovative
approaches? And what pitfalls have they encountered? As always, I will
credit anyone who responds in my presentation, a practice I&#039;ve adhered
to since I began giving talks umpteen years ago--and write a post here also giving you credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva">Thanks so much!</span></p>

At <a href="http://work.io" rel="nofollow ugc">http://work.io</a> some of the staff never has seen each other offline.

“Needing only your laptop and wifi to work is an incredibly enabling gift. Pretty much everywhere i went i had access to wifi and could work on my startup and communicate with my co-founders. Take use of that gift and you will have a life-changing experience. Founding a startup in such a globalized way <em>is</em> possible with some coordination skills. Our whole team is spread around the world for the whole time being and we successfully launched a couple of months ago.”
We have a permanent chat (hipchat) with several rooms (development, communications, sales,…) where everyone shares what they are working on. Officechatter also happens there in form of personal thoughts, videos and links. Every monday is a meeting through Skype/Google Hangout/Phone (whatever is available) scheduled. Beside weekly planning we discuss important topics like where the startup is going and where we put our focus next or new hires.
I haven't seen most of the team since over a year. The person that joined us in 2013 hasn't met anyone of the team before. Some work from coworking spaces, others from home or Cafés. Whatever suits them best.
The biggest problem is feeling disconnected. Before we had the permanent chatrooms most of the communication happened through mail and Skype. One to one. That meant we often talked about what we talked with someone else before. And it happened that someone wasn't in contact with anyone for weeks. No shared successes and the moral sunk. Through the chat many things improved but it still happens when there isn't something happening for some days. Now we encourage everyone to share what they do, where they encounter problems and of course successes.
I believe the emotional part is the hardest. If you walk into a building, even if it's only once a week, you feel connected to it. You see the people, talk with them about non-work stuff and so on. If you only get assignments via mail/Skype you are just a contractor. That is fine for many tasks but it won't work in an startup or if you should represent the company in any way.</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2010/01/19/top-five-trends-in-the-future-of-work/">Thoughtful piece</a> by Brent Frei on why work-at-a-distance works--and will work for eons to come. His trends are in the &quot;yes, of course,&quot; category (principally, technology advances from greater availability of broadband to use of mobile devices) but he manages to pick the best of the lot for his list; his predictions are, likewise, from the general pool of discussion about this but he finds the pick of the litter. Together, they should make the new class of migrant information workers who pack their portfolios with presentations past feel they&#039;re on the right track:</p><blockquote><p>1. Migration of professional people from high tax &amp; regulation states to low tax &amp; low regulation states.</p><p>2. Explosive expansion of work marketplaces and paid crowdsourcing for all kinds of jobs.</p><p>3. More productive people will work for themselves by shopping their
considerable talents around the world via work marketplaces.</p><p>4. Job performance and work quality will become transparent as people’s work is reviewed online much as products are today.</p><p>5. Average earnings for high performers will be more than double the average earnings in their category.</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center"><p style="text-align: left">Maybe it&#039;s this way in all such places. I don&#039;t know. Like you, I&#039;m sure, I try to avoid them.,&#160; But every so often, someone we care about has a &quot;meeting&quot; in one of these places and there you are, waiting. Such was the case this morning when a relative had a rather long meeting with a machine made of magnets. Anticipating that the magnets might be running a bit late, I brought along my computer, thinking I could work while waiting, hoping that if the meeting went on too long, I would be able to find a plug.</p><p style="text-align: left">To my delight, I found a place to sit, a very comfy chair with a coffee table in front, a light on the table behind. Ah-ha! There had to be a plug. A three-pronger, no less. I turned on my machine and ...! Wireless with a welcome notice, allowing me in as a guest, without even registering or providing my name. A good strong 5-bar signal at that.</p><p style="text-align: left">I got to work, opening, storing, deleting, writing...and then and then...just behind me, the gentle plucking of strings. A harpist had come in, set up, not ten feet from me, all so quietly that I hadn&#039;t even noticed until she filled the lobby with a celestial serenade, the lobby, that is, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. </p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d0883401157220f671970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="Harp" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d0883401157220f671970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mt_imported_image_1757842080.jpg" /></a></p> </div>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/08/my-weekly-post-.html">Monique Doyle Spencer</a>, inimitable as always, uses the Red Sox mania of the moment to dismember a habit that is so--what word to choose--DISGUSTING. Yet, being Monique, she manages to do it in a most entertaining way in <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/10/03/chew_on_this_baseball_fans/">today's Boston Globe</a>, where her humor column has become a regular feature:</em></p><blockquote><p>&quot;Chewing tobacco and baseball go together like movies and popcorn,&quot;
people will say. &quot;It's tradition!&quot; I like that argument very much, so
let's renew all of the traditions that go way back in baseball. Tickets
will be 50 cents. There will be no games on Sundays. Men? You will be
dressed in suits and ties and hats. Ladies? You'll have special days
when you can go for free. Guess what? It was also against the rules for
players to be paid. Tradition!</p></blockquote>
