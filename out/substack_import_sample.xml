</p>
<p>A few hours ago, I received this email from my friend of forty years, David Goodman:</p><blockquote><p><em>My mother left this stage at 1:18 AM this morning and is now with my father and brother Andrew and others on the next level. I am sure she is having a fine time.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/us/18goodman.html?ref=obituaries"><strong>Complete obit in New York Times</strong></a>, Aug 18, 2007 </p>
<p>Readers of this blog may remember <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">my post</a> of June 21, where I included, with his permission, the extraordinary postcard that David gave me in May when I had dinner with Carolyn Drucker Goodman (his mother) at her apartment on New York's Upper West Side. At nearly 92, she remained extraordinarily dignified, surrounded by the memorabilia of an historic life and the good taste of a sophisticated intellectual who'd lived in the city and known fascinating people.<br /> </p>
<p>Carolyn Goodman, as in the mother of Andrew Goodman, as in Goodman-Schwerner-and-Chaney, the three young civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi in 1964, here with the other two mothers at Andy's funeral.<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/18/funeral.jpg"><img width="100" height="126" border="0" alt="Funeral" title="Funeral" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/funeral.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
</p>
<p>David's light touch in reporting his mother's death is emblematic of her spirit. She carried herself with rare dignity and grace along avenues where others would have been crawling on the pavement begging. I don't know how anyone survives their child's death, no less brutal murder by the Ku Klux Klan, but she did, while maintaining a complex and influential career as a psychologist (assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein Medical School among other honors-see the jump page for her entire resume and list of publications) and maintaining a lifelong dedication to the <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/andrewgoodmanfdn/">Andrew Goodman Foundation</a> that she and her husband started in 1966.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/196609_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="100" height="129" border="0" alt="196609_cg_photo" title="196609_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/196609_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
From the moment I met Carolyn in 1969, I wanted to be like her. It was just months after her husband had died suddenly of a stroke, barely five years after her son's murder. (&quot;Andy's death killed him,&quot; David once told me.) She was 54 and, at 22, I was overcome with admiration at the composure of this absolutely gorgeous woman, who'd lost her child and husband in such rapid sequence. I was struck also with her beautiful skin (milk baths were the secret, David said).</p>
<p>Many times since, when I've felt overwhelmed by the cards on my table, I've thought of Carolyn, her just continuing, never wallowing, just continuing, positively, without complaint or fury, just continuing.<br /><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/1998_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="100" height="129" border="0" alt="1998_cg_photo" title="1998_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/1998_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a><br />In 2002, I was honored to present her with the Champions of Freedom Award from <a href="http://freedomhouse.com">Freedom House</a>, here in Boston. She was nearly 88 at the time, still very beautiful, warm, and articulate about the choices she'd made in her life.
</p>
<p>So tonight I've lit a very special candle, given to me by Sylvia, my Antioch college roommate, about the time we both met David. Today is Sylvia's 60th birthday and she too was with me for our last dinner with Carolyn on May 18, 2007.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; New York, NY</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; LIFE’S WORK AND CURRICULUM VITAE</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has been working for causes of social justice for most of her life.&nbsp; During her undergraduate years at Cornell University, she and her husband-to-be were involved in organizing Farmer Cooperatives.&nbsp; In the late 1930s she became Women’s Division Chair of the Join Antifascist Refugee Committee that supported Spanish Republicans who fled or were exiled by Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the early years of her marriage to Robert Goodman, a graduate of the Cornell School of Engineering, Carolyn Goodman began her graduate work in psychology.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman became Assistant Clinical Professor, Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Unit Chief of PACE Family Treatment Center a program of the Bronx Psychiatric Center.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Goodman designed the Parent Adult Child Education Program (PACE), in 1968 for emotionally disturbed mothers with high risk preschool children.&nbsp; PACE has been replicated in this country and abroad and in September, 1980 was presented with a GOLD Award for program excellence by the Board of Hospital and Community Psychiatry of the American Psychiatric Association.&nbsp; PACE was also the recipient of the Ruth Kirzon Group Humanitarian Award for Services to Handicapped Children.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Goodman administered the PACE program, provided direct clinical services to parents, children and teachers.&nbsp; She developed curriculum for PACE staff education and medical students, conducted seminars for local and national mental health agencies and supervised Fellows, residents, other clinicians and undergraduate students in the mental health field.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman has written and published a number of articles on the treatment and psycho-education of high risk families.&nbsp; See Attachment A for a detailed list of her Professional Training, Academic Honors, Professional Experience, Selected Publications and Presentations, and Awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman had three sons; Jonathan, Andrew and David born in 1941, 1943 and 1946, respectively.&nbsp; Andrew Goodman, the second of her sons, was murdered for his unflagging belief in equal justice for all.&nbsp; He was a volunteer in the Mississippi 1964 Summer Project, an important step in the Civil Rights Movement involving thousands of students, teachers, lawyers, doctors, and clergymen.&nbsp; Shortly after arriving in Mississippi, on June 21, 1964, he, along with James Chaney and Michael Schwerner, were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia, Mississippi.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deaths of these three young activists was a tragedy that illuminated the evils of a segregated community that shook the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn and Robert Goodman founded the Andrew Goodman Foundation in 1966 to help carry on the goals and dreams of Andrew Goodman.&nbsp; Sadly, Robert Goodman died suddenly in 1969.&nbsp; In 1989, 25 years after the death of her son Andrew, Carolyn Goodman called together the Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner families to form a coalition that would commemorate and perpetuate the legacy not only of the three young men but of the thousands of people, black and white, who had risked and lost their lives in the struggle for civil and human rights.&nbsp; The credibility of the Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Coalition captured the interest of young people and attracted the attention of the national media.&nbsp; A Freedom Caravan traveled from Philadelphia, Mississippi to New York City, where thousands of people heard speakers such as former Governor Mario Cuomo, artists such as Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Peter Paul and Mary, and Jessye Norman celebrate youth action.&nbsp; These artists and speakers reminded the crowd of the need to carry the torch lit by their counterparts 25 years earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the summer of 1994, Carolyn Goodman under the auspices of the Andrew Goodman Foundation sponsored an unprecedented project called Freedom Summer ’94.&nbsp; Through this project, the Andrew Goodman Foundation provided training and technical assistance to youth organizers from all over the country.&nbsp; YouthAction, one of these groups, a national youth organization, formerly part of the Executive Committee of Freedom Summer ’94, continues to train grassroots organizers who are growing in numbers and effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Inspired by the work being done by young people, and frustrated that social action by today’s youth is ignored, Carolyn Goodman and the Andrew Goodman Foundation initiated its latest project, a documentary about youth activism in the 1990s entitled HIDDEN HEROES.&nbsp; This film tells the story of today’s young activists, people who are working to improve the quality of life in their communities.&nbsp; Despite the media’s portrayal of today‘s young people as apathetic and violent, there are young organizers addressing issues of local concern, such as education, ecology, voter registration, anti-drug intervention, and racial tension.&nbsp; HIDDEN HEROES has been distributed to schools, libraries and other educational outlets to inform young people about essential work being done by their peers.&nbsp; The film is accompanied by a curriculum guide, prepared by students under the auspices of the Community Relations Department of Shoreham – Wading River High School of New York, and was developed by a highly experienced educator.&nbsp; &nbsp;It has helped teachers lead discussions that promote a different perspective from that of negative media messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has spoken at schools, colleges, churches, synagogues, museums, the United Nations and before various local, state and federal governmental bodies on all subjects relating to social activism for human dignity and civil rights.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For reasons as yet unrevealed (and certainly not because I subscribe to the fine <a href="http://www.interweaveknits.com/">Interweave Knits</a>), about six months ago, <a href="http://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a> showed up in my mail. And I don't mean my inbox. We have an old-fashioned mail slot cut into the wall by the front door of our old house. For the past six months or so, WIRED has been among the daily deluge of catalogs. When the August issue arrived, I got excited. &quot;How To: ... &quot; followed by a long list that included &quot;Rule the Blogosphere&quot; and &quot;Email like a Pro&quot; got me turning pages.</p>
<p>Well, I'm still looking for tips on how to rule the blogosphere. Great cover teaser, no article by that name. But -- and especially if -- you're a cube captain with action figures decorating your work space, there's lots here for you (e.g., never place Wonder Woman and Superman in, you know, suggestive positions).</p>
<p>There's a great 100-word (if that) squib on what to do if you're the only person dialing into a conference call: &quot;Announce yourself when it begins and remind people that you cannot see air quotes or scribbles on the whiteboard. Have an intern email you digital snaps. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. And mute your phone when you're not speaking, so no one hears SportsCenter in the background.&quot; OR, perhaps, ask your co-workers to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webinar">web conferencing</a>?</p>
<p>&quot;Email like a Pro&quot; is terrific if you're, how shall I say this, engaged in shady activities? The six pointers are aimed at keeping you out of court, or jail, I can't tell. The actual title of this one, &quot;Lawyer-Proof Your Email,&quot; requires no further clarification.</p>
<p>There is a good little list on how to use a wiki. Other than that, the tips on how to refill the watercooler and how to bully your coworkers into donating more leave me, well, wondering why WIRED has sought me out.</p>

In honor of these new children's arrival, I've sent this short piece from </em>The Persuasion, <em>Chapter 18</em>, to the new mothers <em>(photos </em><em>by Priscilla Harmel</em><em>, left of Benjamin Israel, right of Ava Lester)</em>:<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/27/ava2.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/ava2.jpg" title="Ava2" alt="Ava2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a></p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the world of the newborn, in my case, newborns, was familiar terrain to the billions of women who’d come before, but the two six-pound bundles of body, mind, and spirit that I was shuffling from breast to bath to back were portals to a universe unknown, never even considered, with its own rivers and storms, its own unsolvable mysteries.
</p></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>With the births, time forgot the concept of moving forward. It went
horizontal. Where even a week earlier, the hours clicked me along from
my writing desk to the garden to the dinner table to the living room
for a meeting, now they sent me sideways, depositing me in the
after-birth where time advanced so peacefully that I could eavesdrop on
the long conversation between the cardinals nested in the juniper on
the northeast corner of the garage, follow the scrape of Tonin’s pencil
across his big white sheet of butcher paper in his studio up the spiral
stairs, vibrate to the tingle of chimes in the mountain laurel on the
patio below, all background music for the babies as they suckled,
working milk from my breasts, building muscle in their chins and cheeks
for all their jawboning to come.</p>
<p>
I constructed sentences whose words I’d always known but whose peculiar sequencing I’d never before considered.</p>
<p>
What lives lay in front of mine? How many generations would our family endure into the future?</p>
<p>
Who would populate our babies’ worlds? Who would become their jewels, their lifelong companions whose secrets they kept?</p>
<p>
What confusions of the heart, unintended slights, self-doubts, and
disappointments would chafe their routines, pull rugs from under their
precious feet?</p>
<p>
Were my babies’ cries despairs at the plight of human existence or were
they little thespians practicing for their dramas to come?</p>
<p>
How would they solve the riddles born with their souls?</p>
<p>
What foods would the people who grew in me crave? Would they love beets?</p>
<p>
Had they, my little daughter and my little son, had they enough to eat? Would they always?</p>
<p>
Would Tonin’s intuition and my logic short-circuit the genetic wires in their brains?</p>
<p>
Would Andy write? Would Zivvy build? Would she lead an organization; would he be a rock star?</p>
<p>
Or would they move to another planet entirely, another solar system, a
universe far beyond the second floor of this eighteenth-century house
where they were born? Where would I be then?</p>
<p>
Where was my edge limned and where did their selves begin?</p>
<p>
I explored their mental caves, twirling fragments of cognition gelling
in their small brains. I could see through their fleshy foreheads,
rippled with the tracks of the birth canal, into the arithmetic of
their minds, observing ideas dividing and multiplying, memories stored,
the two halves of Zivvy’s brain rushing toward each other at twice the
speed of Andy’s (my facts were never far away). I tried to perceive
from their insides, from their points of view, watching them opening
their eyes to acquire mental snapshots of their new world, and assuming
that, when they closed them, they assembled what they’d captured into
panoramas of their dawning worldviews.</p>
<p>
And who was I on this journey?</p>
<p>
I’d been piecing my own reality together for almost three decades, my
own world, and now my own included two more people I’d never expected,
twin shocks whose arrival toppled my balance and sped me into new
territory.</p>
<p>
They were Tonin’s babies before they were mine, he wanted them long
before I was entertaining thoughts of children, he needed them to be
who he wanted to be. Now I was the mother, not the child without one, I
was protector, provider, materfamilias, once and forever humanity’s
first face to these two of its progeny.</p>
<p>
These thinkings, these awes, these terrors unsettled and delighted me
as baby-time ticked by, every moment, the one after and the one before,
changing Zivvy’s diaper, wiping away Andy’s spit-up. I circled the
whole of Zivvy’s round back with my thumb, working the bubble of air up
her digestive track until she could expel it in a belch louder than she
was big, and then Andy cried out and my chemistry called back, rushing
oxytocin to unlatch the milk locks, trickling out through my nipple
even before he started sucking, on to his cheek as he turned his head
this way and that, searching for the spigot with its hindmilk, the
honey settling at the bottom.</p>
<p>
Twenty, thirty minutes, two hours passed this way, me trying to recall
how long we’d been lying there, which one I’d last changed. When had I
most recently eaten? Had I eaten? Me, no longer simply me.</p>
<p>
Andrew. My father’s name, his genetic material, his head in the palm of
my hand, my little boy’s body stretched out along my arm, his face
wrinkled and splotchy, and, though the same weight as Zivvy, six
pounds, one ounce (I did know how to carry them to term, as I would
prove again astonishingly soon after this), rounder, an integer
shorter, he, a foot and a half, she plus an inch.</p>
<p>
My son with the magnificent feet. I’d never been much of a photographer
but, as a gift to mark the pregnancy, Janos had put a 35-millimeter
Pentax in my hands. Over the course of the past months, I’d practiced,
taking pictures of Treasure pounding down her sourdough loaves and
gathering up her squash blossoms, of the granite Buddha Tonin had set
by the mountain laurel. In early February only Buddha’s crown peaked
above snow and we called him Snow Buddha; in April, he was Tulip Buddha
with pink ones at his feet. And of Tonin, many pictures, of Tonin
examining a bevel he’d just made in an edge, smoothing his palm across
a board he’d just sanded, standing at his drafting board jotting notes
on his big white sheets, cracking eggs into a bowl for our <em>omelettes
aux fines herbes</em>.</p>
<p>
I learned to set the light meter, adjust the shutter speed, snap, snap,
snap, thread the film across the sprockets, and wind the reel in an
instant. Now, I was focusing the 105-millimeter lens down on Andy’s
perfect feet, his long wrinkled toes crimped into the soles.</p>
<p>
Zivvy, born longer, was smooth. Where Andy’s feet captivated me,
Zivvy’s head did, delicate in its proportions, crown to forehead,
eyebrows to chin, nose to cheeks, precise. Her little symmetrical face.
Eyes even, equal, wide, intricately edged lips, pursed, small fist by
her cheek waiting to wave (or punch). She didn’t sleep the way Andy
did, not that she fussed; she came out of me with her eyes open and
stayed awake a good deal of the time. When she did sleep, she woke
quickly, alert, ready to go, my daughter. My daughter.</p>
<p>No longer just a
daughter, now the mother of one.</p>
<p>
Of two.</p></blockquote>

  <title>Boston top blog city</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glad to be contributing to the stats here in The Hub, where, apparently, there are <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/boston_bloggies.html">more bloggers</a> per block than anywhere else on earth, including Silly-con Valley, as per this post to the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/">Daily Business Update</a>. And happy to see our friend, <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/index.html">David Weinberger</a>, quoted, possibly the most quotable person I know:</p><blockquote><p> According to <a href="http://outside.in/Boston">OutsideIn.com</a>,
a website that tracks neighborhood blogging, Boston was the &quot;bloggiest
city&quot; in America for the two-month period of March and April.</p>
<p> Behind Boston were Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p> OutsideIn.com says it tracks blogging activity in about 60 urban
areas and nearly 3,500 neighborhoods, and it arrived at its rankings
through a &quot;blogging quotient&quot; that factors in a metropolitan area's
population with the number of blog posts about a specific location.</p>
<p> By that measure, Greater Boston had 89 posts per 100,000 residents,
edging out Greater Philadelphia, which had 88 posts, and Greater
Pittsburgh, which had 53 posts, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, perhaps, such well-wired metro areas as San Francisco
and Seattle were farther down the list, with roughly 40 posts per
100,000 residents, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Why was Greater Boston number one? Outsidein.com chief executive
Steven Berlin Johnson offered this theory: Blogs thrive where locals
are wired, well-educated, and obsessed with politics, a topic that
inspires bloggers to unleash their prose. Another popular blog topic
locally: healthcare...</p>
<p> Blogs are such a new phenomenon that methods for tracking blog
activity are still in their early stages, said David Weinberger, a
fellow at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p> And in seeking to pinpoint blogging hotbeds, he added, raw numbers
may not tell the whole story; also relevant are the quality of the
content and whether blog posts help build a community.</p>
<p>Still, Weinberger said, &quot;I'm proud to live in the bloggiest city in the universe.&quot;</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ellenmeister.com/">Ellen Meister</a> is a generous contributor to <a href="http://zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a>, where I met her. <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/10/meistercover_2.jpeg"><img width="100" height="63" border="0" alt="Meistercover_2" title="Meistercover_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/meistercover_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
Over the past few years, she's let other Zoetropers peer into her experience as a first-time author with a two-book deal.<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_oe_1_see_all/102-7551158-1680922?ie=UTF8&amp;relSet=0060824816">Secret Confessions of the Applewood PTA</a> </em>came out in hardcover in '06, as did the audio version narrated by Lisa Kudrow; paperback out now. Ellen's doing a virtual book tour, meaning interviews with her in lots of places.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FreePint's <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm">235th issue</a>, just out today, features <strong>My Favourite Tipples, </strong><a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#favourites">literally mine.</a> FreePint goes twice a month to roughly 100,000 &quot;information workers.&quot;</p>
<p>How does something like this come about, my list of favorite websites published in an online newsletter based in the UK? Hint to speakers: As people are coming into your next session, wander around, introduce yourself, ask people's names. Practicing my preaching, I did this at our <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com">Enterprise 2.0</a> workshop that Sandy Kemsley reported on in her post, <strong><a href="http://www.column2.com/2007/06/enterprise-20-reports-from-the-frontier/">Reports from the Frontier</a></strong><strong>.</strong> There I met <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#editorial">Monique Cuvelier</a>, editor of FreePint, who handed me her business card and suggested I might want to write something for the newsletter. After the conference, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/conferring-on-t.html">I fulfilled my pledge</a> to write to everyone who'd handed me a business card. Monique responded by asking me for this little piece.</p>
<p>Why not <a href="http://www.freepint.com/author/">send Monique</a> your &quot;tipples?&quot; Read on for mine.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<p>My Favourite Tipples

<p class="heading"><strong>By Jessica Lipnack</strong></p>
<p class="plain"><img width="90" height="60" border="0" align="right" title="Jessica Lipnack" alt="Jessica Lipnack" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/jessica_lipnack90x60.jpg" />In
my work on networks and virtual teams--and as a writer, I'm always
looking around for creative and thought-provoking ideas -- here's where
I go on a regular basis to shake up my thinking. </p>
<ul class="plain"><li>For original thinking about the far edges of where the Web can take
us, bookmark Minding the Planet, where Nova Spivack holds forth:
&lt;<a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Michael Sampson of Christchurch, NZ, a tireless blogger and expert
on all things collaboration, is also known for his ability to take
verbatim notes at conferences and post them immediately:
&lt;<a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/">http://www.michaelsampson.net/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Writers (aren't we all writers now?), come hither! Francis Ford
Coppola's immensely generous gift to the writing community offers
review exchanges and excellent discussion forums - all completely
free: &lt;<a href="http://www.zoetrope.com/">http://www.zoetrope.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Running a Hospital, the blog of the CEO of a large American medical
centre, is informative about health care, as well as funny and
controversial, and even includes the occasional recipe:
&lt;<a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/">http://runningahospital.blogspot.com</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Travelling on your mind? Don't set foot in Oceania or a good part of
Asia without Turkeynose.com &lt;<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/">http://www.turkeynose.com</a>&gt;, where a
conscientious couple has posted detailed reports of their 6-month
journey, complete with ratings of every activity, form of
accommodation, and restaurant.</li></ul>

Confused by all the new terms that get thrown around in meetings, in the paper, on TV, in emails? <a href="http://commoncraft.com">Common Craft</a>, a consulting company based in Seattle, Washington, has taken it upon itself to define terms in an amusing and easy-to-understand way. Its <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/video/social-bookmarking" target="_self">short online videos </a>-- &quot;Social Networking in Plain English,&quot; &quot;Wikis in Plan English,&quot; and &quot;RSS in Plain English&quot; -- are guaranteed to save you hours of anguish and embarrassment. Take a look and you&#039;ll thank me--and especially Common Craft--for this post.</p>
<p><em>Backstory-ish sort of thing: I found Common Craft because I subscribe (RSS feed) to <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/">KM Space</a>, which I discovered after its blogger, Doug Cornelius, wrote about <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/2007/06/90-people-10-technology.html">one of our sessions</a> at Enterprise 2.0. Thanks, Doug.</em></p>

  <title>Going around IT to connect</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's Boston Globe carries a short piece by business reporter Chris Reidy that is likely to cause some CIO arm hairs to stand at attention. <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a> confirms findings that we published with two business school professors in Harvard Business Review in May '04 (&quot;<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=R0405J">Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger</a>?&quot;).</p>
<p>In the study, designed by USC's Marshall School of Business Professor Ann Majchrzak and UNC'S Kenan-Flagler School of Business Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship Arvind Malhotra, we found that 50% of &quot;far-flung team&quot; members used Instant Messaging (IM) even when their companies prohibited it. The Yankee Group, whose research is reported today, says that only one-third of the companies they surveyed offer IM. But that doesn't deter employees who regularly find the best tools for their work, regardless of corporate IT policies.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: CIOs, Listen Up! Pay attention to the natural resources that your employees gravitate toward. Everyone wants work to be easier and so those with the energy will seek out those tools that serve them best.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>From Boston.com (under 500 words so OK to quote in its entirety):</p><blockquote><h2>Monday, August&nbsp; 6, 2007</h2>
<h3><a target="new" title="Employees bypassing IT departments" href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a></h3></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p> The widespread adoption of consumer technologies in the workplace,
such as outside instant messaging services, poses a potential threat to
corporate information-technology departments, according to a new report.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The report, titled &quot;Zen and the Art of Rogue Employee Management,&quot; is from the <a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/">Yankee Group</a>, a Boston-based market research group focused on global connectivity.</p>
<p> According to the report, nearly 50 percent of employees feel more
empowered than IT to control their personal IT environment, a
development that could lead to a potentially &quot;hazardous mix of secured
and unsecured applications in the enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p> Only about a third of companies offer instant-messaging, and when a
company doesn't, many employees will resort to using consumer IM
products from the likes of AOL or Yahoo to communicate sensitive
company information to colleagues and customers; these consumer
products lack the &quot;robust security&quot; measures that are a key feature of
workplace IM offerings, noted Joshua Holbrook, manager of the Yankee
Group Enterprise Research program. </p>
<p> To address this challenge, the Yankee Group suggests that corporate
IT departments adopt a &quot;Zen-like approach&quot; that doesn't seek to dictate
policy and enforce standards but rather looks to set guidelines and
steer employees in the right direction.</p>
<p>

In 1999 Meston made international headlines when he attempted suicide
to escape Chinese imprisonment. Arrested while researching a potential
World Bank project sanctioning Chinese occupation of Tibetan land,
Meston’s act spurred a worldwide out-pouring of support and led to his
release. <br /><br />
This is a powerful story of one man’s spiritual odyssey from a child
monk to a political symbol of freedom. Abandoned at the age of three by
hippie American parents, and sent to become a Buddhist monk in Nepal at
the age of six, Meston shed his robes and returned to the U.S. as a
teenager to reconcile his past and carve out a new future. While
attending Brandeis University, he married a woman whose family were
Tibetan refugees and began interpreting for journalists and
congressmen, traveling to the area on behalf of human-rights issues.
This gripping and eloquent memoir chronicles his unorthodox path,
offering a universal message of forgiveness along with a glimpse into
the inner workings of Tibetan Buddhism.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </div></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meston has been featured in <em>People</em> magazine and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p></blockquote><p>What makes Daja Meston an Endless Knots author? Your host here (and her hubby) joyfully gave a book party (recorded <a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2007/03/comes-peace.html#links">here)</a> honoring the book's publication. He and his wife, Phuni, are friends of many years.

  <title>Challenges of Virtual Teams</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I had the chance to sit face-to-face with fifty people who work, for the most part, virtually. Their purpose in coming together was to learn some adaptive behaviors when at least one and, in some cases, entire factions of their colleagues are continents apart.</p>
<p>About an hour into the day's session, the leader asked the group to list their challenges in working virtually. Suddenly, a quiet room virtually (!) erupted:</p>
<ul><li>We don't really know one another; it's hard to build true personal relationships</li>
<li>We're unaware of people's real skills</li>
<li>We struggle to understand people with different accents</li>
<li>Our &quot;real-time window&quot; is very small--when we're working, they're sleeping</li>
<li>I feel isolated because I'm the only one on my team who works in a different location</li>
<li>We mean different things when we use technical terms</li>
<li>It's hard to get first-hand information</li></ul>
<p>The list, twice as long as what I'm posting here, points to the central challenge of working virtually: It's not what we see on the screen but what reflects back to us in the mirror. In our view, the key to making virtual teams work is our own ability to connect and communicate maturely, perhaps the biggest challenge of all.</p>

    <wp:comment_content>The challenges for making remote teams work together are enormous, but the benefits are immense (when it works). And I’m not talking about the cost differential between countries, but giving (moral) credit to the best contributors – the “enlightening’ feeling they were part of a bigger thing…
When shaping up such a work model, best practices are great, as a final result, but how you get there?
My suggestions are:
1.  to first research the profile of your team, meet each and everyone face to face in his/her original setting and get a feel about their chemistry (within their local setting) – find out what makes them “tick”,
2.  identity leaders and support group at the ground (functional) level – they will be your core group – the “runners’ between functions,
3.  create strong relationship with the local management – you can’t enforce the project’s rules without them,
4.  make a presentation to the local groups about expectations and send them positive signals about their contribution and how that would fit in the “product”,
5.  make a final presentation to the whole group where you talk about the components, functional groups, project management – the big picture,
6.  get definite buy ins at #4 and #5 and do it fast!
Now you have the framework where the best practices (and collaborative technologies) would work…</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Hi Jessica,
We are reading a chapter from "Virtual Teams" at Quinnipiac University's introduction to interactive communications course.  I really enjoyed the chapter that we read.  Although the trust issue was something I thought was worth discussing, virtual teams are something I don't mind getting used t0 :-)

  <title>Rules for Second Life</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know what Second Life is, then this post's title makes sense -- and that would be 8 million of you (a mere fraction of my readers, of course). And if you've never heard of it, <a href="http://secondlife.com/">take a look</a>: In short, it's an online environment where you can buy virtual land, visit virtual places, make virtual friends, and, in the past couple of years, conduct meetings, go to concerts, even listen to candidates hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Turns out that a bunch of biggies, including IBM, have been scooping up virtual real estate and building their own online environments. We did a quick survey of what's out there for a client last year and were surprised to find how many companies are playing with this technology.</p>
<p>Ever the experimenter, I joined and spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get my bearings and figure out how to &quot;fit in.&quot; Having never played a video game beyond Frogger (oh, for those innocent days), I was a clumsy Second Lifer. Mainly, I felt like a rube. The &quot;clothing&quot; that comes with signing on left me feeling a lot like my grandmother must have when she stepped off the boat from Rotterdam onto Ellis Island. The previous immigrants had hip, imaginative appearances. I was from the Old Country.</p>
<p>But, alas, it's a generous world and a &quot;woman&quot; (she could have been a hermaphrodite, no way to tell, but her avatar was a woman) from Denmark (or Mars, again...) sent me a text message, offering me some hand-me-downs. Quickly, I looked a bit more like a native.</p>
<p>OK, back to The Rules. IBM has issued <a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html">some guidelines</a> for its 5000 virtual employees. Well, I guess they're actual employees participating virtually. From Rachel Konrad's article and with thanks to Eric Bedell's superb <a href="http://thiswebday.com/">This Web Day</a> for the pointer (hi, Eric!):</p><blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><br /></span></span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span id="article"><span style="font-size: 0.8em"><span style="color: black"><span id="article"><span id="intelliTXT"><p>
IBM's rules - which apply to &quot;Second Life,&quot;&quot;Entropia
Universe,&quot;&quot;Forterra,&quot; There.com and other worlds - are logical
extensions of the real world: Don't discuss intellectual property with
unauthorized people. Don't discriminate or harass.</p>
<p>
Guidelines also include a 21st-century version of the Golden Rule: &quot;Be a good 3D Netizen.&quot;</p>
<p>
Other rules are unique to the metaverse, which requires users to create
animated avatars with distinct appearances, personalities and gestures.
&quot;Second Life,&quot; owned by San Francisco-based Linden Lab, has more than 8
million avatars; most look human, but many take the form of chipmunks,
zombies or fantastic beasts.</p>
<p>
IBM, whose 20th century employees were parodied as corporate cogs in
matching navy suits, doesn't have an avatar dress code. But guidelines
suggest being &quot;especially sensitive to the appropriateness of your
avatar or persona's appearance when you are meeting with IBM clients or
conducting IBM business.&quot;</p>
<p>
Rules caution workers who have multiple avatars or frequently change
their avatar's appearance. It's common to have numerous avatars -
similar to having multiple <a target="_blank" href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20070726/D8QKGKAO0.html#" class="iAs" style="border-bottom: 0.075em solid darkgreen;font-weight: normal;font-size: 100%;text-decoration: underline;color: darkgreen;background-color: transparent;padding-bottom: 1px">e-mail</a> addresses for work and personal use.</p>
<p>
&quot;Building a reputation of trust within a virtual world represents a
commitment to be truthful and accountable with fellow digital
citizens,&quot; IBM states. &quot;Dramatically altering, splitting or abandoning
your digital persona may be a violation of that trust. ... In the case
of a digital persona used for IBM business purposes, it may violate
your obligations to IBM.&quot;</p></span></span></span></span></span></p></blockquote>

  <title>The best bar on the most beautiful block in NY</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now I'm not much of a bar hopper (my friends and family are now doubling over in laughter at the thought) but when I happen on a place like this one, it's definitely worth a blog entry.</p>
<p>Some very close friends of mine had a welcome home party on Sunday, honoring their return from <a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/">a long trip.</a> They're not that old, so inviting all their friends to gather at a bar is de rigeur. I was invited too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.habanaoutpost.com/">Habana Outpost</a> in Brooklyn's Fort Greene is not to be missed. For starters, it's the first &quot;eco-eatery&quot; in NY. What does that mean? It's solar powered, everything is recyclable, and even the smoothies are blended with bike power. Second, you can take your dog, at least to the outdoor seating (which is all I saw). Third, the Cuban menu includes corn on the cob rolled in something that is positively delicious (though not identifiable to this gourmande). Fourth, there's a fashion flea market set up around the perimeter but inside the bar's fence (yes, it's a fence). Fifth, they show movies at night. I could go on but just look at <a href="http://www.ecoeatery.com/press/index.php">the pictures.</a></p>
<p>Then take a walk down South Portland Avenue, toward Fort Greene Park, and see what Time Out New York&nbsp; calls &quot;the most beautiful block in New York.&quot; No surprise to me. It's Brooklyn, my mother's beloved hometown.</p>

Now we&#x27;ll need to do the calculation of total energy taken in and used by a human being to stir up a drink -- versus .5 kwh or less from a power plant.  It may be -- just maybe -- that it is actually more energy efficient to do the latter.  But it may depend on the time of day you order the drink.  If it is off-peak, in terms of regional power usage, the energy may come from a very efficient generating plant.  It also depends on what your biker eats.  If he eats corn-fed beef from a feed lot in Iowa, his energy conversion ratio may not be very good!  (Kind of like ethanol made for automobiles.)<br/>More than you want to know???</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.75em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">jessica lipnack</div><div style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">July 27, 2007 at 08:03 AM</div><div style="color:#444;">Not even nearly enough.

And did I mention that there&#x27;s a wall fixture, outside, that looks like a fan but in fact is a solar powered cell phone charger with three adapters (one for Blackberries)?</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.75em;"><div style="font-weight:600; color:#333;">Paul Levy</div><div style="font-size:0.85em; color:#777;">July 27, 2007 at 10:03 AM</div><div style="color:#444;">I will loan you my solar powered calculator . . .</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content>Bike power??  Now we'll need to do the calculation of total energy taken in and used by a human being to stir up a drink -- versus .5 kwh or less from a power plant.  It may be -- just maybe -- that it is actually more energy efficient to do the latter.  But it may depend on the time of day you order the drink.  If it is off-peak, in terms of regional power usage, the energy may come from a very efficient generating plant.  It also depends on what your biker eats.  If he eats corn-fed beef from a feed lot in Iowa, his energy conversion ratio may not be very good!  (Kind of like ethanol made for automobiles.)
More than you want to know???</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Not even nearly enough. We need a pocket calculator, ooops, how dated, a widget with us at all times to understand the energy equation. But did you notice that the whole place is solar powered? And did I mention that there's a wall fixture, outside, that looks like a fan but in fact is a solar powered cell phone charger with three adapters (one for Blackberries)?</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/antioch/index.html">a few problems</a> at my alma mater of late, which have captured my attention sufficiently to get me to attend alumni meetings, where passionate grads are arguing the future of one of America's great institutions, Antioch College.</p>
<p>So while I'm sitting at the most recent one trying to follow the conversation, someone said something that has proved to be the only direct quote I recall from the meeting: &quot;Email is for old people.&quot;</p>
<p>The speaker, whose name I've been trying to get but alas, she may not reply to email, went on to say that &quot;young people post. They don't email.&quot;</p>
<p>I email and I post. Like right now. This is a post. I've been thinking since about what this might mean. Is there only direct 1:1 communication in public? In private forums that the public can join by registering?</p>
<p>We know from our research over the years -- and we are by no means the only ones recognizing this -- email has its limitations. Long discussions do not lend themselves to email. Bulletin boards, threaded discussions, and Internet buzzword of the moment, wikis, do.</p>
<p>Having been involved in computer conferencing (what the wiki idea stems from -- Hello, <a href="http://web.njit.edu/~turoff/">Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz</a>) for 25 years now, I am a committed believer in &quot;public,&quot; many-voice conversations. But I ain't throwin' in the towel on email yet. Nothing is better for 1:1 asynchronous (different time) communication (gospel according to me).</p>

    <wp:comment_content>I think Skooter has it right.
Also, for me, email is really a business tool.  When you get hundreds per day, no single message can warrant enough attention to be intimate in the manner of conversations or hand written letters.  When it IS used for exchanges with friends, it is for logistics (e.g., dinner plans) or to exchange a quick laugh or observation or pass along something of interest.</wp:comment_content>

NY Times Book Review, tomorrow, July 15, 2007 does a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/15tbr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">nice call out</a> to his <em>Bourne Betrayal </em>and gives Eric the space to explain how he's writing books about Robert Ludlum's characters. Interesting writing proposition, Eric, and what a great gift from Mr. Ludlum's family. Open to answering a coupla questions here? Now, I've put you on the spot.</p>
<p>Antiochian alert: Eric went to grammar school with Neelon (nee Pepper) Crawford, '69, married to Susan Hill, '70.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="bold">THE BOURNE RESURGENCY:</span> Robert Ludlum died in
2001, but his books keep coming. The new one, “Robert Ludlum’s The
Bourne Betrayal,” written by Eric Van Lustbader, rises this week to No.
9 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/bestseller/0715besthardfiction.html">fiction list</a>.
Van Lustbader, who also publishes thrillers under his own (excellent)
name, took over the Bourne franchise a few years ago. On his <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/index.asp">Web site</a>,
he notes that some people “still seem confused by my writing novels
about a character created by Robert Ludlum.” For anyone who is still
puzzled, here’s Van Lustbader’s stab at <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/news.asp">clearing everything up</a>:
“I was asked by the estate of the late Robert Ludlum to continue the
series Bob started. He wrote three Bourne novels (‘The Bourne
Identity,’ ‘The Bourne Supremacy,’ ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’). ... I have
so far written ‘The Bourne Legacy’ and ‘The Bourne Betrayal.’ These
books are written entirely by me from my own ideas, though some people
persist in thinking that I wrote them with Bob. This would be rather
difficult to do, since he’s dead. Also, he left no notes or unfinished
manuscripts pertaining to Jason Bourne. Are we clear now? Good!”</p></blockquote>

Q?
A: [as in ask yourself the first question - dirty pool :)]
Q: In Agatha Christie's obit (don't remember where), she was quoted as saying she really wanted to be a concert pianist, not a mystery writer. You?
Q: You said you don't hang with writers cuz they're too similar to you. Who then? What varities?

    <wp:comment_content>Q 3: the famous OrgScope.  I'm actually contemplating writing a XXX-rated short story with the OrgScope as my lead character.  He's a hard-boiled private dick in a near-future world similar to that of "Blade Runner."
Anyway, he's half-man, half-machine.  Which is where the OrgScope comes in.  In this world, the Puritans have taken over (except for Las Vegas, where the last group of free-thinkers is hiding out in the Bellagio Hotel).

Only our hero rebels, falls in love with Scarlett Johansson (in the film version 'cause maybe then I can meet her) and now they're both being hunted by the dreaded OrgPolice.
However, our hero has the amazing ability to organize the last free-thinkers into a superbly well-oiled rebel army and... well, you can guess the rest.  Except that I'll bet you can't guess the identity of the OrgPolice mole inside the band of free-thinkers.

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a few weeks, New England's farmers markets will be swimming in zucchini--and they've always got a plenteous supply of basil. Where am I going with this? One of the best recipes I've learned in a while, which was handed up to me by <a href="http://elizastamps.com">Daughter #2</a>, who got it from <a href="http://turkeynose.com">Daughter #1</a>, who got it from one of the glossy food mags, likely Bon Appetit. #2 and I made it last weekend to great ummms, equipped with only a mini-prep (baby food processor). Then I made it again a few days later for a dozen. I'm putting it to the scale test later this week when I'll make it for 40. Wish me luck - and try it.</p>
<p>It's very hard to wreck this as it only requires making (or buying for undaring or busy) pesto, possibly the easiest, most delicious thing you can make. Pesto is a very much to-your-taste food. Can be more basil-y, more garlic-y, more oil-y...and it doesn't matter. Keep adding ingredients until it tastes just right to you.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Zuke Ribbons with Pesto Pasta (for 4) </p>
<p>
Ingredients:<br />
<em><br />
Pesto Sauce</em><br />
2 c fresh basil - cut off woody stems but I leave most of the stalks on<br />
1/2 olive oil (organic, extra-virgin, first cold-pressing for the fussy, me)<br />
1/2 cup grated parmesan or peccorino or reggiano or combo of all<br />
1/3-ish cup pine nuts (some people use walnuts but if anyone has nut allergy, leave this out)<br />
2+ cloves garlic (or a lot more - my fave ingredient so I go heavy here)</p>
<p>Salt and pepper to taste (I always use kosher salt or other large-grain)</p>
<p><em>Zukes</em><br />
2-3 whole zucchini (peeling it is the hardest part, no cooking)</p>
<p><em>Pasta</em><br />
12-16 oz linguine, fettucine, or pappardelle (my fave)</p>
<p><em>Tools:</em><br />
Knife<br />
Food processor<br />
Garlic press<br />
Vegetable peeler<br />
Big pot<br />
Cutting board<br />
Salad spinner (for drying basil; if none, use dishtowels, or, in a pinch, bath towels :)<br />Colander (or strainer or even the cage of the salad spinner)<br />Tongs (or a wooden fork if not tongs)<br />Serving bowl (use pasta pot if you don't have anything else)</p>
<p><em>Preparation:</em><br />Cook pasta al dente. While it's cooking, make the pesto.</p>
<p>Wash basil several times. It's always dirtier than you want it to be. Trim stems.</p>
<p>Pack basil into food processor, turn on high, and drizzle a little oil in. Add parmesan, drizzle a little more, and keep processing. Add pine nuts, drizzle, process. Add garlic, drizzle, process, taste. Alternate until you've added everything and like the consistency. I like it creamy, others like it grainier. Adjust seasoning. Like it cheese-y? Add more. Garlic enough for you? More oil? All your call.</p>
<p>About now the pasta should be done. Drain it, reserving just a little water. When pasta is all drained, dump it back in the pot with a half cup or so of the cooking water. This prevents pasta gumming up (trick learned from Chris Tung, incredible chef at <a href="http://www.ankhura.com/">Ankhura).</a> Mix and leave it for a while.</p>
<p>Time to peel the zucchini. This is the hardest part. One long peel after another along the length of the zukie without turning it. After about five or six peels, you'll start to hit seeds. Turn zuke and repeat peeling process until you've turned it all the way around. Goal is to have a bit of green skin on each length of peel. Makes for prettier finished product. Ok, that's done.</p>
<p>Mix pesto into pasta (that's a fun sentence to write) using the tongs. Point is mix thoroughly and not cut pasta by mistake. But if you do, not problem. Then add zukie peels a few at a time until you like the way it looks.</p>
<p>Move to serving bowl and sprinkle with grated cheese. Or put it on a serving plate on top of pretty red-leaf lettuce. And/or decorate with more basil sprigs.</p>
<p>Serve at room temp. Leftovers are great, hot or cold. I added extra pesto the next day and sauteed the whole thing with a little olive oil.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;ve <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/antioch/index.html">posted</a> about this before. Today, I&#039;m cross-posting this letter to fellow alums on college-related chat lists, wikis, and such. What do you think?</span></em></p>
<p>Photo from Dayton Daily News, May, 1967<br />Mary Lou Merriwether, on set of THE ANTIOCH ADVENTURE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Dear Antiochians,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My name is Mary Lou Merriwether. I attended Antioch for ten days in the Spring of 1967, during which time I studied, went on coop, found a boyfriend, was cheated on, learned to dance, and graduated, riding out of town in a cap and gown on a BMW R69S.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My real name is Jessica Lipnack. I was the star of “The Antioch Adventure,” Marc Stone’s genius film that people on this list still want to see. (Also had a cameo in Thanos Fatouros’s “Antioch Adventure: Part II”—even got the T-shirt).</p>
<p>Like nearly all who went there, I loved Antioch.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>I chose Antioch over Barnard and NYU, went on coop to NY, LA, Yellow Springs (assistant managing editor of The Record one quarter, Assistant Community Manager another), and San Francisco; went AEA to Oxford (first Antioch woman to attend), and went Own Plans to Mexico and Boston. I graduated with a BA in Philosophy in 1970, when Antioch was at the height of its powers.</p>
<p>I’m writing this post because I still love Antioch and I’ve had the experience that most others writing here have not had: In 1999, I joined the Board of Trustees. I was flattered to be asked, of course, but, when I agreed to join, I honestly had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p>Serving on the Antioch Board is a huge amount of work, a lot of travel, and a significant hit to one’s personal bank account: Three major meetings a year, each three or four days long, rotating among the campuses, meaning several cross-country trips; many, many conference calls; smaller committee meetings sometimes face-to-face; reams of reading material; detailed financial statements to absorb; many complicated issues to solve; the expectation that you’ll make significant financial contributions; and, of course, the dramas that accompany being on any board…dominant personalities, people who occasionally don’t get along, others who become ill, and I haven’t even mentioned yet all that comes from the campuses themselves, where administrators, faculty, and students are living the decisions that the Board, with the best of intentions, makes.</p>
<p>So serving on the Antioch board is time consuming, expensive, and, frankly, often thankless. That said, I was lucky to hold one of the only fun positions during my tenure: I chaired the Trusteeship Committee, which considers and recruits new trustees and is supposed to nurture existing ones (though there was hardly time for that). Many of us agreed that bringing new blood onto the board was critical to the survival of the College so that’s where I put my energies. A number of those recruits are on the board now, as are many colleagues from my tenure, whom I trust and love. Generally speaking, I found my fellow board members to be honest, hard-working, diligent, intelligent, and absolutely committed to doing the right thing for the college and the university.</p>
<p>Serving on any of the other committees could not be described as fun—it is plain hard work. Even so, everyone showed up for the most difficult committee meetings—Finance. Imagine sitting through grueling detail of the college’s finance reports when none of the targets were met, then having to figure out, every four months, how to plug the dyke. It is not literally true that the board, during my tenure, was taking votes up or down on the college’s continued existence, but the writing was clearly on the wall. Antioch College has not been viable for a very long time.</p>
<p>No one here would want to have been sitting at the table as a Trustee at the June 9th meeting where they took the decision to halt operations. Most of the board are graduates of the college – only four of twenty or so are not, and one of those is a graduate of Antioch New England (who also happens to be the person who recruited me, possibly the most upstanding public servant I’ve ever met). I know the decision was agonizing and the outcry—and attacks, my fellow alums, yes, some of you are attacking these people J—must be very difficult to not take personally if you’re a trustee.</p>
<p>I resigned from the board after one term. I disagreed with a key decision in regard to hiring. When you can’t support the decisions your fellow board members make, either get with the program or leave. It was an agonizing decision (ask my family) and I felt awful “deserting,” the word I used at the time, my fellow board members. They are probably more mature than I am – and those people are still there — and still working to do what is best for Antioch.</p>
<p>But I didn’t disagree with the June 9th decision. When I heard the news, I applauded. And when I saw the ill-informed op-ed in the NY Times, I wrote a letter, which they didn’t publish. Finally, a group of very responsible grown-ups was able to make a very difficult decision. There was nothing in it personally for the Trustees except the kind of backlash they’re experiencing, but as good stewards of a national treasure, they have acted in its best interest.</p>
<p>OK, so where does that leave us? Here are my assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all want our alma mater to continue to exist.</li>
<li>There is not enough money to continue operations as is. There is a minimum shortfall of $5 million annually and without an endowment in the hundreds of millions, we can’t plug the gap.</li>
<li>The “business model” for Antioch needs to be brought up-to-date. When I was a student, I could afford to travel, put down money on apartments, and have enough left over to go to Com’s for dinner. Not so now. Whose parents have $5-10K to drop twice a year for half of an apartment somewhere, then pay airfares (and buy textbooks at $70 a pop)?</li>
<li>We need to pay our faculty what they’re worth, not below-market wages.</li>
<li>We need a compelling vision that puts Antioch back in the game, so the College can then choose those students whose goals best match the unique education that it offers.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here’s my proposal: I’ve seen a lot of good ideas floating around (and a lot of opinions drawn from downright wrong information).</p>
<p>** Let’s together gather all the good ideas and find productive ways to apply our collective brainpower to working them up into really creative solutions.</p>
<p>** Let’s use <a href="http://antiochians.org">Antiochians.org</a>, which is shaping up into a good online discussion space to work with them for now, then move forward using the best technology for large-scale online conversation. (I’ve spent my career writing about and consulting on collaboration, with some expertise on the technologies to support it; may I join the IT group?)</p>
<p>** Let’s bring forth the organization development people among us to facilitate, cool things down, and work out differences. One of the Trustees is world-class in this regard.</p>
<p>** Let’s identify the academics, administrators, and businesspeople among us who have the experience and capacity to develop a positive business plan.</p>
<p>** Let’s raise the $40-$50 million for the endowment that’s needed right now and then let’s recruit the best fundraisers among us to bring our endowment in line with the Oberlins of the world (theirs is $750 million).</p>
<p>** Let’s get together with Trustees as often as we can face-to-face, have conference calls, webinars, podcasts, 1:1s, and do whatever it takes to build trust both ways.</p>
<p>** And, to my former colleagues on the Trustees: take all the risks you can to make everything transparent to this very committed and loving body of however-many-thousand alums.</p>
<p>I believe the Board of Trustees needs and welcomes our encouragement and support, our creative thinking, our partnership, and our financial commitment. We must all come together.</p>
<p>Having sat in both places—as a trustee and as an alum—I am absolutely confident that we all want the same things for our beloved college and that we can invent and populate a new institution that Horace Mann, Arthur Morgan, and even our distinguished alums, like Coretta Scott King and Stephen Jay Gould, would admire.</p>

The BOT&#x27;s failure to raise the money they committed to raise to support their renewal plan should be ample evidence of their poor understanding of student recruitment, costs associated with turning the curriculum on its head, and what the real problems were/are.  I serve on boards and have recruited members to serve on boards.  I know how time consuming and costly it can be.  But, that&#x27;s the job.  Board recruitment and training should be carefully managed.  If it hasn&#x27;t been, if people have not understood their responsibilities, the time and expense involved, etc. then this is also another problem directly attributable to the board.  You resigned when you disagreed with a BOT decision.  What are the faculty and staff of Antioch College supposed to do?  How many times are we supposed to step up when we have been so grosely let down?  I invite you to come to campus to witness how the current faculty steps up to not only teach students in classes, but assist them in multiple ways during this difficult year.  Yes, we are still stepping up to do our jobs--which is, by the way, to teach and participate in our college community.  Come and sit in one of our classes and see how we are doing our jobs.  Perhaps if the BOT had done more of that they would have arrived at some different conclusions--maybe then they would have been able to make well-informed decisions.

Unfortunately, many community colleges now also compete  for that area of the market.<br/>In order to create a compelling vision for the College, I think Antioch will have to decide if it is willing to embrace elitism or if it would prefer to be a community college. I don&#x27;t believe it can do both, at least not well.<br/>How plausible is it for these two entities, the University and the College, to separate at this point?</div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, many community colleges now also compete  for that area of the market.
In order to create a compelling vision for the College, I think Antioch will have to decide if it is willing to embrace elitism or if it would prefer to be a community college. I don't believe it can do both, at least not well.
How plausible is it for these two entities, the University and the College, to separate at this point?</wp:comment_content>

[Photo by&nbsp; Paul Garber, courtesy, Muir Heritage Land Trust]<br /><br />I'm always amazed at how committed and creative people are when pursuing their passions. Here's a great example of a grassroots (look at the picture) networking effort that's literally transforming the landscape. The fine folks organized by the <a href="http://ridgetrail.org/">Bay Area Ridge Trail</a> are nearing completion of the 400th mile of trail around San Francisco Bay--for horse riding, biking, and hiking. On the weekend of June 2-3, 250 volunteers turned out&nbsp; to complete the trail through&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.6em"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Muir Heritage Land Trust’s Sky Ranch in Martinez, California. Thanks to Morris Older who edits the <a href="http://twha.org/">Tilden-Wildcat Horsemen's Association</a> Newsletter for all his hard work and for the tip. (Disclosure: he's my cousin.)<span style="font-size: 0.8em">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 0.6em"></span><span style="font-size: 0.6em">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 0.6em">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.mercedgroup.com/">Catherine Shinners</a> is an anthropologist working as a marketing and strategy consultant who understands technology. We met at <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com">Enterprise 2.0</a>, which I've blogged <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/webtech/index.html">here</a> and others have blogged <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/events/ent2_Jun07/materials-blogs.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/09/9010_e2conf.jpg"><img width="100" height="55" border="0" alt="9010_e2conf" title="9010_e2conf" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/9010_e2conf.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
Shortly after the conference, I received this nice note from Catherine. Here she focuses on the <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com/conference/new-ways-to-work-organization-20.php">&quot;90% People, 10% Technology</a>&quot; session that I ran. She points to the affective/emotional elements of the presentations--the smile of one presenter (Milton Chen, on screen), the profound hearing loss of another (Jeff Stamps, third from right). Also here from right me, Bill Ives, Tom Witkin, Dan Somers, photo from <a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net">Michael Sampson</a>, who took <a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/2007/06/notes_from_90_p.html">verbatim notes</a>.<br /><br />Excerpted here with Catherine's permission. Thanks!<br /></em></p><blockquote><p>Jessica,</p>
<p>I thought you and Jeff brought a great energy to the conference and had a few impressions to note in this brief email for now.</p>
<p>Jeffrey's personal story about how he best collaborates and the effective way he collaborated with the young man in India was communicated in such a direct, personal way, and was very moving to me and I'm sure the rest of the audience.</p>
<p><a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Emiltchen/">Milton Chen's</a> <a href="http://vsee.com/">VSee</a> demo was astonishing in its simplicity and impact, and he has, what must be the most disarming smile ever....when is a smile a smile?&nbsp; When Milton is communicating his passion.</p>
<p>The sessions you crafted that focused on how real people do real things with the tools and technologies were so relevant to an audience wanting to know how to make it really happen.&nbsp; It was an important balance to a conference that highlights technology.</p>
<p>Best regards<br />Catherine Shinners<br />Merced Group<br />650-704-38898<br />www.mercedgroup.com</p></blockquote>

    <wp:comment_content>
need many more case studies at e2.0....less s/w promotion!!!
the balance this year tilted too much towards vendor showcasing with MANY being identical...not enough diversity
demo pavillion a Loss/failure....terrible space planning and logistics...had I been there, I would have been very disappointed
organized 1:1s:  this would be better...organize a way for folks to meet on a pro-active basis versus the way done this year
like Boston as venue
hotel was great, except for Pavillion
pre-reads and post-reads:  would be nice to have materials ahead of time, post-reads, and a year round Forum for dialogues, rants and discussions....keep the collaboration going
Thanks, L  (720 839 5068)

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I relaunched Endless Knots, I figured I'd post a bit then get serious about publicizing its existence. As things have worked out, I've posted quite a bit but have yet to publicize the blog at all. Meanwhile, I appear to have a steady daily readership of about 50 people from around the world. While I can see which countries you're coming from (which I intend to make public as soon as I can get the little utility that shows that working -- it's easy! just paste this html code into your page! bah humbug!), I don't know who you are.</p>

<p>(OK, that's two posts in a row begging for responses. Probably time to eat dinner, the recipe for which I'm working hard to find a way to link to collaboration. Hang on. I prepared it with my daughter. That's collaboration, yes?)</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back when I relaunched this blog - four weeks ago - I asked for <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/yay_or_nay.html">your opinion</a> as to whether my eclectic choice of topics is a + or a -.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continue to write about what interests me, what moves me, and what I'd like to understand better. This means that I often stray off-topic, if you're reading here because you think I'm only interested in networks, networking, collaboration, virtual teams, and, etc, on like that...</p>
<p>It's a big, crazy world, and I'm voraciously interested in many things. Shall I keep throwing them out here or stick to the business basics for which <a href="http://netage.com">NetAge's</a> work is known? Please post your thoughts here.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago today at about seven in the evening, my best friend, Linda Bryce Russell Haber, died in NYU Hospital. The <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EEDC133FF936A15754C0A9659C8B63">death notice</a> in the New York Times announced her memorial service but it did not capture her spirit.</p>
<p>On the &quot;jump page&quot; here, as the newspapers call it, I'll add a few paragraphs that I read at her memorial.&nbsp; If you die in NYC, have your service where Linda's was held: <a href="http://15stfriends.quaker.org/">The Fifteenth Street Meeting House</a>, in the handful of most beautiful buildings in the city. Set on a park, all white interior with simple benches, in the spirit of The Society of Friends.</p>
<p>I met Linda when I was 15; she was a year younger but had skipped a grade. We were incoming sophomores at <a href="http://www.georgeschool.org/">George School</a>, the Quaker boarding school in Newtown, PA. Within weeks we were the best of friends. Then as can happen with friends, we had a 20-year hiatus, reconnecting five years before she died.</p>
<p>Cause of death: At 39, Linda survived an aortic dissection, the result of her having <a href="http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/marfan-syndrome">Marfan Syndrome</a>, the genetic disease that strikes down seemingly healthy basketball players. Linda had the same physique as they -- tall, very long limbs, long fingers -- and she was a phenomenal athlete, the tennis player that no one, including the boys in our school, could beat. As she was recovering from the dissection, she developed kidney disease, also genetic, leading to a kidney transplant. Recovering from that--and while taking massive quantities of anti-rejection drugs--she developed endocarditis. Then, as she was just about out of the woods, the truly unexpected: her beloved, healthy, athletic, funny husband, David Haber, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, the brain tumor so difficult to survive. Linda died six months after David's diagnosis, suffering an aortic aneurysm while hoisting her oxygen tank into the car on her way to bring David home following one of his surgeries. David died eighteen months later.</p>
<p>When she died, her nephrologist called her &quot;the bravest person I've ever known.&quot; More here...</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Linda came close to dying several times, once two years before she actually did. I wrote a letter to her then, which I read in full at her memorial. Here are a few grafs (again newspaper-talk):</p>
<p><em>...You were an immediate icon in the school. Gorgeous, tall, athletic, brilliant, funny, and the younger sister of two alums, as well as the daughter of one. Quaker, from Sewickley, and perhaps the best tennis player George School had ever seen. You swore on the court, became angry at yourself with such vengeance that it scared your opponents. What if you became that angry at her? You had the largest vocabulary of anyone in the school, including the teachers. The most beautiful arches. Boys in line in adoration, M., chief among them. He so brilliant that no one could understand him — except you. You spoke French and Russian brilliantly, one of a handful of students whom Madame V nurtured (while I., her son, was in the line of boys). Cool. So Cool...<br /><br />I don’t remember becoming best friends. I do know that we instantly were. We were the teenage friends that others our age wish they had had. No secrets. Nothing sacred. We laughed to tears before we could cry. Gossip. More gossip. Ideas, intellectualizing, hypothesizing, philosophizing, spiritualizing, psychoanalyzing ourselves, each other, and everyone else. Sharing our psychic powers. Sneaking to the woods to smoke even though it made us sick and dizzy. Traveling by train to Philadelphia, where we scarffed down eggs, sausage, and potatoes just a few blocks from the train station, and to New York, where we ate cream cheese omelettes by the dozens at Tant Mieux, and of course traveling to Pottstown. Suffering through our mutual ailments. Dissecting our past, present, and future boyfriends until they were dust. Finally sharing a room our senior year, an excruciating one for both of us...<br /><br />Our legacy of laughter and pain reincarnated instantly three years, three months, and two days ago when I returned your phone call of the previous evening, my birthday. Just a few months earlier, your picture from junior year had fallen out of my carton of George School memories. I had tried to find you without luck the year before, calling all the Linda Russells in New Jersey. This time I wondered if I could conjure you up so I placed your picture on my bookcase and looked at it every day. Apparently my call got through...<br /><br />Our phone calls of the last three years, enough to wrap around the earth a million times (whatever that means), but certainly enough to keep your darling, devoted David glued to his phone bill, have been our mutual mothering. Calling you is a singular joy — you always happy to hear from me, ready with incisive advice that I may not want to hear, penetrating inside problems, and revealing their core while I rush past. You grab me, make me stop, and really look. You understand. You know me. And I miss you terribly already, Linda.</em></p>
