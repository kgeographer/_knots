  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been adding links left and right, well, right, next column over, so many in the past few weeks that I'm definitely going to leave someone out but here goes. If I don't mention you, ping me and you'll get your own special post.</p>
<p>My writer friends at <a href="http://zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a> keep blogs, so you'll see lots of those: Lawyer-turned-author <a href="http://perpetualfolly.blogspot.com/">Cliff Garstang</a> (Perpetual Folly); baseball buff <a href="http://www.donaldcapone.blogspot.com/">Don Capone</a>; the legendarily-generous-to-other-writers <a href="http://ellenmeister.blogspot.com/">Ellen Meister</a>, author of <em>The Secret Confessions of the Applewood PTA</em> and forthcoming <em>The Smart One; </em><a href="http://gerardsmith.blogspot.com/">GC Smith</a>, who posts a lot of poetry; <a href="http://www.insideoutchina.blogspot.com/">Xujun Eberlein</a>, who's making her insights available on Inside-Out China and whose book, <em>Apologies Forthcoming</em> is due out in '08; <a href="http://pageboulevard.blogspot.com/">Karen Condon,</a> who's just started up at Life on Page Boulevard; <a href="http://www.kellyspitzer.com/">Kelly Spitzer</a>, whose Writer Profile Project I've made the cut for next August (stay tuned); <a href="http://www.lailalalami.com/blog/">Laila Lalami</a>, who's been blogging longer than almost anyone I know, and whose work you will come to know if you don't already (<em>Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits, </em>op-eds in The New York Times, book reviews in The Nation, many more); <a href="http://www.maryakers.blogspot.com/">Mary Akers</a>, whose co-authored <em>Radical Gratitude</em> is coming soon; <a href="http://blahblahblahwriter.blogspot.com/">Sandra Novack</a>, with two books coming from Random House (yay, Sandra!); <a href="http://maryannestahl.blogspot.com/">Maryanne Stahl</a> (check out the tiger picture on her blog); and <a href="http://writingneuroses.blogspot.com/">Kay Sexton</a>, far and away the most prodigious blogger I know - she keeps six or nine or 96 - I can't remember!</p>
<p>Sarah Levy's <a href="http://firstcrush.wordpress.com/">First Crush</a> (my vote for best blog name) demystifies wine and is beautifully written (even if you're not on Zoetrope, Sarah).</p>
<p>On the collaboration frontier, check out Robin Good's <a href="http://www.kolabora.com/">Kolabora</a> and Margaret Rouse's <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/overheard">Overheard in the Blogosphere</a>.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wait, there's more. A bit stunned that I'm flogging Vanity Fair's July '07 issue again, I read on and have to relay this: There are also worthy reads on Jeffrey Sach's approach to economic development in Uganda, the effective use of anti-retrovirals, and a music festival in the Sahara, snapshots of 20-some inspiring leaders a la Mandela and the Ivory Coast Soccer Team, and ... because it is, in the end, Vanity Fair, Tina Brown on Princess Diana's &quot;love that got away.&quot; </p>

    <wp:comment_content>Dear Jess, I looked at your web
site  - and the section on Current Affairs - since I have no blog to write on - I wondered
if you  noted that tiny blurb in
the Globe a couple of days ago
which came from the NY Times - and said that something like $282,000,000. in US dollars had
been stolen from an Iraqi bank
either by Iraqui security guards or ?  I was totally
outraged, thinking of all the
underfunded and sagging US programs, ie. Soc. Security,
the environment cleanup and a
host of others that could have
been funded by our tax payer
dollars which were stolen.  Is
that part of the "progress in
Iraq touted by Bush and ilk?
Why wasn't this a huge headline?  See if anyone else
noted this little known fact.
It's probably the heat that's
making me sour about all these
things.  On a funny note, I
was cleaning out a bureau in
the attic for Kate to take and
I came across a print that I
had done in art school.  It was
an abstract design and I had
included the following sentence
in large letters:  Do You Think
God is Dead?  I thought of
presenting it to Ron on Wed.
pm?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like the title of Alexandra Krasne&#039;s new piece in PC World: &quot;<span style="font-size: 13px;font-family: Arial"><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/155657-2/manage_telecommuters_without_losing_your_mind.html">Manage Telecommuters Without Losing Your Mind</a>.&quot;</span> And she points to one of those delicious metrics that everyone hungers for around issues like virtual teams, collaboration, and telecommuting:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">According to a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/152127/telecommuting_is_good_for_business_study_says.html">survey commissioned by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA)</a>,
67 percent of survey respondents said their organization has
experienced greater worker productivity as a result of allowing
employees to telecommute, either full- or part-time. The main reason
for the increase in worker output: less commute time.</p><p>Here are the &quot;key findings&quot; in the <a href="http://www.comptia.org/sections/research/reports/200809-TelecomSummary.aspx">CompTIA web-based survey</a>, &quot;Trends in Telecommuting: Organizations are Realizing Benefits and Addressing Challenges:&quot; </p><ul>
<li> The majority of respondents (78%) report that some
employees within their organizations telecommute,
at least part-time.</li>
<li>However, most organizations do not have a high
percentage of full-time telecommuting employees.
The vast majority of organizations (82%) say that less
than 25% of employees telecommute full-time.<br />
</li>
<li> Employees in IT management (41%), field technical
support (37%), and administration (35%) most
commonly telecommute (part-time or full-time).<br />
</li>
<li> Top benefits of telecommuting to organizations include
improved productivity (67%), cost savings (59%),
access to more qualified staff (39%), employee retention
(37%), and improved employee health (25%).<br />
</li>
<li> Significant challenges of telecommuting to organizations
include securing corporate information systems (53%),
limiting use of unauthorized and unsupported devices
(38%), and controlling personal use of corporate mobile
assets (33%).</li>
</ul>
<p>To the last point, please note emphasis here on &quot;control&quot; issues rather than mentioning the behavioral ones. </p><p><strong></strong></p>

    <wp:comment_content>I know a number of people who are telecommuters including a woman who manages a world wide project and raises about 5 kids of which 3 are about 4 years old. Others work on network and infrastructure applications work.
As best I can tell the problems they encounter are also the ones they would encounter at the office, i.e. communications difficulties among peoples who are continents  apart.  As one person said, "No use going to the office because my team is distributed around the world anyway."
So what's the point. The point is that without the expense of the office, we save a bunch of money and carbon output that can be used for more productive activities.
Maybe we can now depopulate cities and make better use of our nation's land.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a few weeks, I'm giving a faculty development session on blogging for professors in a graduate leadership program. Then about six weeks after that, I'm doing another program for a professional audience on &quot;the art of blogging.&quot; Any reader-blogger-teachers/professors here? If yes, then, please lend a hand. All responses will be acknowledged with attribution unless you want to remain anonymous, similar to what I did with the &quot;<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/01/the-wisdom-of-b.html">Blogging for Creative Writers</a>&quot; course earlier this year (thanks again to all 35 bloggers who responded to that call).</p>
<ol><li>How does blogging aid your courses?</li>
<li>Do you only blog about the pedagogy or do you also indulge in other areas of self-expression?</li>
<li>What, if any, topics do you regard as off-topic/out-of-bounds?</li>
<li>Has anything particularly (choose your adjective) funny/scary/ridiculous/inspiring resulted from your blogging?</li>
<li>What pointers do you have for your colleagues just beginning to blog?</li></ol>

    <wp:comment_content>How does blogging aid your courses?
my students enjoy and learn from interacting online with persons who are unable to speak but who type and demonstrate their communicative and intellectual competence through facilitated communication.
Do you only blog about the pedagogy or do you also indulge in other areas of self-expression?
we blog about anything that vaguely has to do with facilitated communication, although we often stray into social justice, interpersonal issues, politics, childcare, or whatever the daily concerns of the membership are.  members often express themselves with poetry, video, photos, and essays.  a few members have their own websites.
What, if any, topics do you regard as off-topic/out-of-bounds?
when interchanges become personal or uncivil, i rein them in.  if we are waaaay off-topic, i will gently ask for focus.
Has anything particularly (choose your adjective) funny/scary/ridiculous/inspiring resulted from your blogging?
my students and i have been incredibly energized by members with Autism Spectrum Disorder or other movement disorders who have become independent communicators, college/university graduates, and advocates for others who are "neurodiverse."
What pointers do you have for your colleagues just beginning to blog?
try to practice good listening skills, restating what you don't understand or find offensive, just in case it wasn't written clearly and didn't intend what you thought.  give people the benefit of the doubt.  work with people to improve their written expression.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heard this great quote yesterday at a knowledge management conference. Unfortunately, I missed the source so whoever the brilliant thinker is, apologies for not being able to attach your name. The speaker (another whose name I missed - appears to be a pattern) used the phrase as a way of setting a vision for knowledge dissemination. I like it. What I don&#039;t like is the word &quot;management&quot; after knowledge as if it reports to you, is subject to performance reviews, or perhaps gets assignments...</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/16/bostonnow_logo_blue.jpg"></a><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/16/bostonnow_logo_blue_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="174" border="0" alt="Bostonnow_logo_blue_2" title="Bostonnow_logo_blue_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bostonnow_logo_blue_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a></p>
<p>Sorry to learn that BostonNow, the free local paper that had built its circulation to 119,000 in just a year, has shut down. <a href="http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2008/04/14/bostonnow-to-shut-down-immediately">According to the notice on the site</a>, &quot;rapidly deteriorating economic conditions&quot; are the cause. <a href="http://media.www.jsons.org/media/storage/paper139/news/2008/01/01/BostonNewEngland/Bostonnow.Shuts.Down-3324390.shtml">JSONS</a>, Journalism Students Online News Service, goes into more detail about the paper's financing:</p><blockquote><p>Current financial problems faced by its prime investor, an Iceland
based company called Bauger-Group, triggered BostonNOW's closing. Last
week, Bauger-Group sold all of its media holdings to Dagsbrun Media,
which in turn shut down BostonNOW.</p></blockquote><p>We here at Endless Knots, being me in thoroughly self-referential form, are particularly sad as I'd been named a &quot;featured blogger&quot; on the site, meaning I was listed on its homepage. Just a week ago, they'd contacted me, asking for pictures and permission to use my name and image in an advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The exposure was great. Every day, I posted here and on BostonNow, which meant that I had even more readers. A number of my posts were chosen for reprinting in the paper as well. So good for us bloggers and quite sad for those working at the paper.</p>
<p>You'll be missed. And thanks, editors, for all the efforts.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/05/oscarberg.jpg"><img width="100" height="100" border="0" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/oscarberg.jpg" title="Oscarberg" alt="Oscarberg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
Further to our new friend Oscar Berg in Sweden, who's thinking about green teams. Go, Oscar! He's &quot;<a href="http://www.thecontenteconomy.com/2008/01/taking-challenge.html">taking the challenge </a>to write a checklist for situations when I need to get together
face-to-face and when other alternatives such as web conferencing might
be just as suitable or at least possible.&quot; </em></p><blockquote><p> A post by <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/12/carbon-neutral.html?cid=94170782#comments">Jessica Lipnack about “carbon-neutral teams”</a> gave me the idea and <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/01/choosing-trains.html">being quoted on her blog provided some extra motivation.</a> I am involving my fellow bloggers Henrik and Anders (Anders wrote a peace called “<a href="http://www.thecontenteconomy.com/2007/02/are-we-finally-ready-for-ecomeetings.html">Are we finally ready for eco-meetings?</a>” a while ago). Anyway, we are compiling a list of candidate items for the checklist and I hope to present it in some time.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know that you can calculate how much emission of carbon dioxide you cause by flying? <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/pages/TechnicalAdvisoryGroup.asp">The CarbonNeutral Company</a> offers calculators and <a href="http://sasems.port.se/EmissionCalc.cfm?sid=geninfo&amp;lang=1&amp;utbryt=0">the airline SAS</a>
actually allows you to compensate for the emission of carbon dioxide
(CO2) that you cause when you travel with them. Good initiative. But
what we need is to do is also to compary flying to other transportation
alternatives.</p>
<p>Let’s take my flight next week from Malmö to
Stockholm and back again as an example. By taking the plane, I would
have caused an emission of 0.1644 tonnes of CO2. By taking the train
instead, I will cause an emission of only 0.00012 tonnes of CO2. Do I
need to say more? I guess not. I will take the train from now on.</p></blockquote><p><em>And I posted this back to Oscar's blog (nothing like self-quoting):
&quot;I played with the numbers a little to make them more understandable to
those of limited intelligence like myself: if a ton is 2000 pounds,
then your flight would release the equivalent of a sumo-wrestler worth
of CO2 (328 pounds), while the train ride would release something like
a cup of coffee, four ounces.&quot;</em></p><blockquote></blockquote>

    <wp:comment_content>Bring the "Ecoquestion" to the meeting
Hi ! Jessica promoted your excellent initiative. I like the checklist framework and the focus on the person and the total behaviour very much !
However - I would like to add something which focuses more on the meeting in itself. From my perspective most meetings have a seller/buyer set up. The seller is mostly often travelling to his/her customer and want the meeting to be as natural to the customer as possible. On top of that "vendor" part is eager not to miss any signs of dissatisfaction about solutions/products and the real " face to face" meeting is the only way to make sure that the customer is happy, the way to present new solutions and sell more..
This is truly limiting the possiblities of decreasing travelling for meetings. For breaking this behaviour we really need to be well prepared and brave.
Is it a first time meeting? - ok perhaps seeing each other in person is a good idea( at a reasonable level of course depending of the reason and distance)
But at the end of the first meeting - focus on how you should collaborate from there - commonly decide how often you should meet in person, virtually, phone, mail etc. Making it a a good habit of always asking the "ecoquestion" at every meeting. How could we efficiently keep up to date in the future ? Asking that question is also making the "customer" involved in the continued outcome of the meeting. When seeing the environment and talking you are also able to make a judgement of this persons “comfort” zone when it comes to collaboration tools and skills.
He/She will be more willing to make an extra effort in order for the collaboration to work efficiently even if not "face to face". Then following the continued advice of the checklist ...</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been pretty cold, snowy, rainy, and icy here in Boston of late, leaving a lot of the dreaded sheet of slipperiness in odd patches around town. I fell last night and though I didn't hurt myself at all it does prompt me to post this note, reminding everyone to keep their eyes open. I slipped in my driveway in the dark. I hadn't come far enough in to set off the motion detector.</p>
<p>That said, my very close friend did take a terrible spill during an ice hockey game last Saturday, resulting in a broken femur, surgery, and a lot of pain. He fell when a player on the opposing team &quot;checked&quot; him, which is not supposed to happen in Saturday morning play among adults of a certain age. So it's dangerous, this ice. Be careful and make sure, if you're a hockey player, that the rules have been spoken and acknowledged by all before play begins.</p>

  <title>Bored on conference calls? Relief!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lest we drop a key thread in this blog (by virtue of my &quot;other passions&quot;), here's a bit of collaborative advice that I published a while back in <a href="http://www.line56.com/">Line56</a>, which apparently is being rehabbed at the moment. If you've been on a conference call that caused more yawns than yabbers (possibly you're on one as you're reading this), read on...</em><br /><br />
</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 0.6em;color: #990000">Teleconference Boredom? Five Steps to Relief</span></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="border: medium none;padding: 6pt"><em>Don't drag the central location conference speaker across the table. It's painful for those dialing in.</em><a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/articles%20-%20new/telcon-boredom.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><em>[1]</em></a></p>
<p>The reminder above to avoid hideous noises while on a teleconference call, though primitive, rings true.</p>
<p>Witness yesterday: “First let me promise you there will be no trains coming through on this call.” Dave
&nbsp; Rimmer, a Shell U.K. Exploration and Production Information Manager, was recalling a previous teleconference with us in Aberdeen, Scotland, and him in Lowestoft, England.</p>
<p>When Dave’s on a teleconference and a train goes by, as it does every half hour or so in the U.K.’s most easterly town, it sounds like the engine is full throttling out-of-control down the phone line, rather frightening if you’re unprepared. Much like the screech of the dragging phone, it does damage to our overly-exercised eardrums.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Getting the sound at the right db level is only a pre-requisite for
a virtual meeting, not a promise.&nbsp; &nbsp;While effective virtual meetings
are gratefully acknowledged and result in better communication, the
more frequent bad ones add to the organizational grumble and contribute
to distraction. Even face-to-face meetings are unpleasant enough; now
we have to suffer through even worse virtual ones?</p>
<p>What to do, oh, Virtual Beatrice? (I once wrote an advice column.)</p>
<p>Agree to the few following big basic rules — and follow them. They are essentially common sense. Until&nbsp;
good virtual meetings are as second-nature as good phone calls, never deviate from the basics.</p>
<p>Hold all meetings in a virtual team room where only best practices
prevail — even if you’re meeting face-to-face.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, hold all
real-time meetings from within your team’s virtual room. What is a
“best-practices” virtual team room? Key successful methods for virtual
work inform the room’s design. Follow the “instructions” by populating
the room’s walls, and your team is on its way to effective virtual
meetings.</p>
<p>Keep everything the team needs in the virtual team room. Mission,
vision, charter, tasks, actions, discussions, deliverables, agendas,
meeting notes, attendance lists, documents, presentations,&nbsp;
spreadsheets, accountabilities, contact information, links, operating
principles, norms, decisions. Everything.</p>
<p>With all of that available, now have your virtual meeting using a teleconference with real-time web conferencing <em>and</em>:</p>
<ol><li>Follow a realistic, timed-out agenda that you follow</li>
<li>Get everyone’s “voice in the room” at the start with a check-in question — fun is better, but go
&nbsp; &nbsp; serious if necessary for the party-poopers</li>
<li>Have one person facilitate while someone else takes notes</li>
<li>Skip the status reports (post them ahead to the team room where
people can read and prep for the meeting; use the real-time for the hot
stuff--decisions, disagreements, and other dastardly things</li>
<li>Close the call with a “self-propelling ending” (so-named by Shell
Information Consultant Fiona Windle). Hear everyone’s voices again to
address what was learned that you can apply immediately.</li></ol>
<p>It’s work, yes, to do all of this, but so is the alternative with
poor communication and grumpy team members.&nbsp; &nbsp;With the approach above,
meetings do get better. You can “hear” smiling faces.&nbsp; &nbsp;And, it’s
highly unlikely that anyone will allow a train to run through your
meeting while dragging the phone across the table.</p>

My hubby has been coming to <a href="http://www.bearisland.org">this paradise</a> since he was four; I started when I was 23, which means we’ve been walking from the east side of the island, just above The Carry, to the Mail Dock (where the <a href="http://cruisenh.com/MtWashington/day/MailCruises.php">M/V Sophie C,</a> the US mail boat delivers the daily post), on the west side, for 37 years. The first time each of our kids made the trek across the island is recorded in pencil on the window jam.</p>
<p>There is no bridge to the island, no roads, only footpaths. Back in the day, Bear Island was a destination for wealthy summer vacationers. A train from Boston brought people to a ferry, which was met by a horse carriage that transported guests up the pine path to the wide wrapping porch of the Bear Island Hotel.<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/hotelfront_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="62" border="0" alt="Hotelfront_2" title="Hotelfront_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/hotelfront_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a> </p>
<p>Its foundation and a scattering of wrought iron frames and stoves remain strewn in the forest, a fire of dubious origin having burned down the hotel in the Great US Depression in the 1930s as its owner was seen leaving the island.
</p>
<p> When we put in a phone in the early '70s, we were one of only two camps in our &quot;village&quot; with such links to the outside world (the other at the lovely camp of &quot;the doctor&quot; on the point)--and our neighbors made fun of us. I thought we'd justified the installation by choosing a red phone - for emergencies only. That I regarded a phone as more important than indoor plumbing, which we didn't acquire until 1989, reveals a bit more about myself than perhaps I should :).</p>
<p>So yesterday, imagine this: high-speed internet was installed in our chicken coop, literally, yes, a chicken coop, hauled over sixty years ago on a barge by my father-in-law and his friend Seth, whose children &quot;live&quot; next door and remain our very closest of friends.</p>
<p>Yes, folks, wireless in paradise. Or is that an oxymoron?</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/01/bica2_2.jpg"><img width="100" height="81" border="0" alt="Bica2_2" title="Bica2_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bica2_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, my headline writer only punches out questions today.</p><p>As prep for an upcoming workshop on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471388254/netagethenetworkA">virtual teams</a>, I talked with the North American head of human resources for a global manufacturing company this week. She&#039;s got people in half a dozen locations, reports into the global head of HR in Europe, and spends a lot of time on planes and in conference calls. No surprises there and a great example of the need for better <a href="http://www.netage.com/virtualteams/index.html">virtual teaming behaviors,</a><span style="font-family: Arial"> spécialité de la maison</span>.</p><p><span style="font-size: 13px;font-family: Arial"></span></p><p>What surprises me is this - her estimate that she receives <em>perhaps</em> three (as in one-two-three) voicemails a week. A week. Put that up against her daily dose of 100 emails.</p><p>When&#039;s the last time you got - or left - a voicemail? For me, it was with this exec. Instead of writing an email as our first communication (I&#039;d been told to call her by someone in her organization and she was expecting to hear from me), I keyed in her number and got vmail. Moments later, she called back. Interesting technology. Leave message, receive response.</p><p>So I&#039;ve been thinking. How many vmails do I actually receive? The dentist office calls to remind us of appointments - an actual person. The doctor&#039;s office calls and leaves a frightening message delivered by a robot: &quot;This...iz...a...culll...forh...Jezzika...Leepnuck...&quot; And every now and then, &quot;Don&#039;t be alarmed!&quot; says a very alarming voice. &quot;There is nothing wrong with your account!&quot; What account? Why the alarm? &quot;To take advantage...&quot;</p><p>Please, my friends, call me. Now I feel really terrible.</p>

  <title>The life of the indie consultant - long post</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I launched this blog, I promised to talk about the career Jeff and I have chosen, one that others, particularly those just starting out, sometimes lust after. Freedom, independence, travel - and the biggest of the biggies - working with a wide array of very interesting, very smart, and exceedingly kind people in various sectors. All true.</p>
<p>Before going on to my rant (it's coming), let me recount some of the more fascinating assignments: a 14-day, 5-Asian-country &quot;mission,&quot; as they call them, for the UN Development Programme; a three-month, day-in and day-out gig working with a &quot;strategic initiative&quot; for a firm that saw itself becoming part of a &quot;networked community;&quot; several journeys to the Swedish countryside to educate executives on virtual working; a speaking tour across Japan accompanied by an entourage; and a nearly year-long stint setting up the first global software organization for the computer company that makes my favorite products. I get that wonderful swirl in my tummy whenever I think of these experiences, remembering conversations, meals, and the warmth of connection, i.e., I've made many close friends around the world.</p>
<p>But, independent consulting also brings difficulties: no predictable income, promises from clients that never prove out, and, inevitably, working with uninteresting, not evidently brilliant, and perhaps unkind and rude--or at least thoughtless--people.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, my friend <a href="http://groupjazz.com">Lisa Kimball,</a> who's been traveling this same path for many years (sometimes even with the same clients), sent me a link to a post that speaks to the last part of the previous sentence: <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/clients/how-to-identify-the-3-types-of-flaky-clients/">How to identify the three types of flaky clients</a>. I read it, winced, and filed it, deciding not to post about it as it would only make people feel bad. You have to swallow a lot in this kind of business, not the least of which is the kind of flakiness described in the post. What are the three? &quot;Wet,&quot; meaning they stick around but melt before leaving any accumulation of income; &quot;tiny,&quot; the type that string you along with small, empty promises, meeting to meeting, but never produce a contract; and &quot;icy,&quot; who are, in two words, downright mean. Which brings me to this post.</p>
<p>Client flakiness can be unnerving and disappointing and a real hit to the bottom line. But what really irks me are the people who act as if because they are &quot;the client&quot;--which, often, they are not, i.e., only a potential client--they are entitled to behave in ways they never would with people they actually work with. Sorta like the way anonymous posters behave online saying things they would never say to your face. Know the type?</p>
<p>Not so long ago, we attended a meeting with a group of very high-powered business people. The kind with multiple degrees, stellar resumes, heads of this and that unbelievably important thing. Extremely clever with words. Highly polished. In other words, very very very smart. We hadn't asked for the meeting. Rather, a colleague, a truly wonderful woman who fits all of the previous descriptions - brilliant, innovative, multiple degrees, extremely learned, etc. - introduced us to the CEO of her company, who has an urgent need for what we do. We had an electric meeting, said CEO becoming so enthusiastic about our work in collaboration - a big challenge for his company with its many locations and many partners - that he quickly arranged a meeting with his senior people.</p>
<p>Now, before I go into detail, let's review my considerable bad here: I
did not properly vet the meeting. I should have had another call with
the CEO to confirm its purpose, why he'd invited the people he had, how
to engage them, and what report, if any, he wanted back. Instead, I
accepted the meeting while standing in the blazing sun running through
a dozen messages during a break at a very important day-long meeting. In short, *I* was not
thoughtful, intelligent, or considerate.</p>
<p>On we go: Having attended roughly 10 million such meetings, I'm always prepared for the unwilling attendee. Most times these people remain quiet, more recently with arms extended below conference-table-level as if you can't see that they're actually reading their mail on their Blackberrys (in olden times--say, three years ago--they pretended to be taking notes while actually they were making lists).</p>
<p>The meeting in question was no exception. Several arms stretched below table level from the get-go but we soldiered on ignoring their ignoring us. Occasionally one of them would raise their eyes to correct something I had said (can't remember them correcting Jeff, actually, probably cuz he's smarter than moi). Every now and then it appeared that one of them was actually paying attention because the question related to what we'd said. If you've ever presented at a meeting that others didn't want to attend, you know how this feels.</p>
<p>Then came the corker, the remark that has festered, the moment that typified the experience: I was explaining a technicality (normally, we try to avoid technicalities but, as I said, an attendee had just gone out of his way to tell me I was using the wrong word) when a young man (at least I think he was young - you can't really tell anymore) stopped me: &quot;You've got seven minutes to show me your thing,&quot; he said. (Get your minds out of the gutter, readers. He was referring to software we've developed.)</p>
<p>I feel compelled to reiterate that the theme of the meeting was collaboration. Means working together. Usually is suggestive of being polite, cooperative, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I'll leave that in a paragraph of its own just so you can ponder it.</p>
<p>Well, when I was younger, I probably would have gotten flustered at this, tried to accommodate him, apologize, in other words, accept that this was in any way a legitimate thing to say to someone who's gone out of their way to share their best thinking with you, given up their valuable time (yes, the consultant's time has value too), and chosen to pollute the environment with their non-hybrid vehicle. But, coupled with the person who literally was doing his mail <em>on</em> the table, the one who'd corrected me, and the person who began the meeting by announcing that he was leaving, I said, in short, &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Every thing you'll ever be taught about business consulting is that you never contradict the client. You always find a way to make that person feel that what they're saying is appropriate, if not fascinating, revealing, extraordinary. But, this was just rude. No, I wouldn't show him my &quot;thing&quot; in seven minutes. We'd continue our discussion at our own pace. Had I been alone, I honestly believe I would have left.</p>
<p>Because that too is what this kind of career gives you. The freedom to walk out, fire a client, even a potential one.</p>
<p>Rant over.</p>

We decided that there are some natural TRIZ organizations that somehow manage to go right to whatever response will get them the exact opposite of what they (think they) want.  Like collaboration.

Your example - of someone writing a report for free alone on collaboration - is perfect. Now, if only I'd have the guts to leave. Next time and I know you'll be cheering me on. BTW, I had exactly the opposite response today at a potential client meeting. The people were engaged, wonderful, brainstorming together! Happy we were there! Surely something is wrong :)</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, we get a request for copies of the &quot;Decide to Network&quot; postcard, backstory <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2010/09/decide-to-network-by-robert-muller.html" target="_self">here</a>. One such came yesterday, prompting me, post-Boston Marathon, to remember the power of this message. As noted before, when <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2010/09/robert-muller-1923-2010-a-truly-happy-man.html" target="_self">Robert Muller</a> sent us this poem in 1981, there were <strong>4 billion</strong> people in the world; 32 years later, we&#039;re <strong>7 billion</strong>. There&#039;s a great deal more to say about Boston, the kind of post that takes a few hours, not a few minutes, like this one. </p>

  <title>Hello from Hanoi</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people dislike Instant Messenger, find it intrusive, wish it had never been invented. Not me.</p>
<p>1. I have the luxury of working in a small organization so even if everyone interrupts me at once, it's quite manageable;</p>
<p>2. I don't have many other people on my buddy list (perhaps I'm unpopular, after all); and</p>
<p>3. It allows me to be in touch with my kids.</p>
<p>Such was the situation night before last when my traveling daughter's name came up with a big hello!</p>
<p>--How's Cambodia? I said, their last known whereabouts.</p>
<p>--We're in Hanoi and why don't we do a video ichat?</p>
<p>Which we did for the next two hours, with near-perfect reception, talking from our chicken coop to a hotel in Hanoi with faultless high-speed internet service, absolutely free, cheaper than Skype even.</p>
<p>Hanoi.</p>
<p>I couldn't get over it.</p>
<p>--Imagine, I said, 30 years from now, your child contacting you from Baghdad, then appearing as a hologram in front of you.</p>

  <title>Virtual teams poorly managed, say 1 in 3 execs in Economist study</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like some quite solid research from the Economist Intelligence Unit, &quot;<a href="http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=NEC_Managing&amp;page=noads">Managing virtual teams: Taking a more strategic approach</a>.&quot; In the study, conducted in Fall 2009, a third of those executives surveyed said that their virtual teams were not well managed, yet most endorsed using them nonetheless. The major findings (go to link to download the study):</p><ul>
<li>Executives are generally positive about working in virtual teams. More than two out ofthree survey respondents believe that the advantages of working in a virtual team outweigh the disadvantages. Three out of every four respondents also state that they travel less as a result of working virtually.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The single most common challenge, selected by 56% of executives polled, relates to the misunderstandings that emerge as a result of cultural and language differences from teams operating globally. Just one in 20 executives say they have never experienced any difficulty in managing a virtual team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More than one-half of executives say that their virtual teams use video conferencing on a regular basis. This rises to about two-thirds (64%) for the largest firms (those with annual revenue in excess of US$10bn), prompted in part by significant cutbacks in corporate travel budgets over the past two years. But visual communication does not always equate to better communication. Both cultural and gender-based differences need to be taken into account when choosing methods of communication. <strong>Research suggests that that men find eye contact threatening, while East Asians are more comfortable using other approaches, such as instant messaging</strong> (my bolding not theirs).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One in three companies has set up virtual working so that they can tap into the global talent pool. One of the most significant benefits of being able to use technology to collaborate globally is the ability to draw on a much deeper pool of skills, without being constrained by geographical location. Yet the majority of survey respondents say that virtual team members are recruited by local managers (58%), suggesting that most companies only recruit in locations where they have an office, thereby severely curtailing the size of the talent pool on which they can draw. Also, relatively few managers embrace the actual technologies they use to communicate in their virtual teams as the method for meeting and interviewing new prospects.</li>
</ul>

I agree that this is the next &quot;frontier&quot; in developing management techniques and skills. It also has implications for executive/management coaching. New approaches need to be developed for that arena as well.<br/>My reply: Ruth, have you spotted any great examples of virtual exec/mgmt coaching?

Ruth says: Thanks Jessica. I agree that this is the next "frontier" in developing management techniques and skills. It also has implications for executive/management coaching. New approaches need to be developed for that arena as well.
My reply: Ruth, have you spotted any great examples of virtual exec/mgmt coaching? Of people who've been coached this way and are better for it?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since just before 7 this morning, I&#039;ve been receiving text messages from the daughters as they stood in line to vote in Brooklyn. For #1, the wait was two hours; for #2, 2.5 hours. Now they leave for Pennsylvania, picking up their &quot;aunt&quot; (my very dear friend Judy, so close we declared ourselves sisters long ago) on the way, to assist in getting out the vote there. Dedication! And we&#039;re walking to our local polling place now.</p>

Hard to read, I realize, so here&#039;s the &quot;informative&quot; text: &quot;JESSICA, TRY THIS. IT&#039;S <span style="text-decoration: underline">REALLY</span> GOOD! J&quot;</p><p>Ok, it&#039;s a marketing ploy from someone trying to sell me something. Howevuh, I&#039;ve been receiving these missives, sometimes with ads, sometimes with articles, very occasionally with some kind of religious message FOR YEARS! Maybe 20 years.</p><p>I have no idea who&#039;s sending them. J, who are you? And why are you so reluctant to reveal who you are?</p><p>Anyone else ever had anything like this happen</p><p>UPDATE: Forgot to mention--all are postmarked Santa Ana, Calif, with no return address.<br /> </p><p></p>

    <wp:comment_content>Ditto! Although I haven't received one in a couple of years, I'd say 20 years was the norm for how long I've been receiving them.  I, too, suspected it was from an old colleague who had moved on...but subsequently tossed the first and everyone since.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica, even I have received these over the years.  Seems the post mark was from Utah, so my first inclination was somebody from my Alma Mater (BYU).  But over time I convinced myself it was just marketing.  Clever though don't you think?  I mean it managed to get all of us talking about!</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be careful before accepting the next invitation you receive via email. The person sending it may actually have been asleep. According to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W6N-4V34RRS-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3c34302da87c41645169463bf5841907">the current issue of Sleep Medicine</a> (apparently, that is, as, although it&#039;s hard to believe, I&#039;m not a subscriber), researchers report that a 44-year-old woman went online and invited friends over for caviar and drinks--while asleep. The culprit, it would appear, is her sleep medication, Zolpidem, i.e. Ambien CR. I&#039;ve found a bunch of links to the story but I like this one by Roger Dobson because of the graphic, &quot;<a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081215/jsp/frontpage/story_10253153.jsp">Wake up to zzz-mailing - First case of sleeping person sending message over Net</a>,&quot; in the Calcutta Telegraph:</p><p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px"><strong>London, Dec. 14: </strong>Doctors
have reported the first case of someone using the Internet while asleep
after a sleeping woman sent emails to people asking them over for
drinks and caviar. </p>
<p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px">It was only when a would-be guest phoned the next day to accept that the woman found out what she had done. </p>
<p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px">The
44-year-old woman, whose case was reported by researchers from the
University of Toledo, Ohio, in the latest edition of a medical journal,
<em>Sleep Medicine</em>, had gone to bed around 10pm, but got up two hours later and walked to the next room.</p>
<p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px">She
then turned on the computer, connected to the Internet and logged on by
typing her username and password to her email account. She then
composed and sent three emails. </p>
<p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px">Each was in a random mix of upper and lower cases, not well formatted and written in strange language. </p>
<p class="story" style="text-align: left;margin-left: 40px">One read: “Come tomorrow and sort this hell hole out. Dinner and drinks, 4pm. Bring wine and caviar only.&quot;</p><p class="story" style="text-align: left">Now we must ask. Am I awake while writing tHiz? Come tomorrow and help sort me out.</p><p class="story" style="text-align: left">(Thanks to Mona-Lia Ventress for pointing me to it on <a href="http://www.zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a>.)<br /> </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FreePint's <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm">235th issue</a>, just out today, features <strong>My Favourite Tipples, </strong><a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#favourites">literally mine.</a> FreePint goes twice a month to roughly 100,000 &quot;information workers.&quot;</p>
<p>How does something like this come about, my list of favorite websites published in an online newsletter based in the UK? Hint to speakers: As people are coming into your next session, wander around, introduce yourself, ask people's names. Practicing my preaching, I did this at our <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com">Enterprise 2.0</a> workshop that Sandy Kemsley reported on in her post, <strong><a href="http://www.column2.com/2007/06/enterprise-20-reports-from-the-frontier/">Reports from the Frontier</a></strong><strong>.</strong> There I met <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#editorial">Monique Cuvelier</a>, editor of FreePint, who handed me her business card and suggested I might want to write something for the newsletter. After the conference, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/conferring-on-t.html">I fulfilled my pledge</a> to write to everyone who'd handed me a business card. Monique responded by asking me for this little piece.</p>
<p>Why not <a href="http://www.freepint.com/author/">send Monique</a> your &quot;tipples?&quot; Read on for mine.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

my work on networks and virtual teams--and as a writer, I'm always
looking around for creative and thought-provoking ideas -- here's where
I go on a regular basis to shake up my thinking. </p>
<ul class="plain"><li>For original thinking about the far edges of where the Web can take
us, bookmark Minding the Planet, where Nova Spivack holds forth:
&lt;<a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Michael Sampson of Christchurch, NZ, a tireless blogger and expert
on all things collaboration, is also known for his ability to take
verbatim notes at conferences and post them immediately:
&lt;<a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/">http://www.michaelsampson.net/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Writers (aren't we all writers now?), come hither! Francis Ford
Coppola's immensely generous gift to the writing community offers
review exchanges and excellent discussion forums - all completely
free: &lt;<a href="http://www.zoetrope.com/">http://www.zoetrope.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Running a Hospital, the blog of the CEO of a large American medical
centre, is informative about health care, as well as funny and
controversial, and even includes the occasional recipe:
&lt;<a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/">http://runningahospital.blogspot.com</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Travelling on your mind? Don't set foot in Oceania or a good part of
Asia without Turkeynose.com &lt;<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/">http://www.turkeynose.com</a>&gt;, where a
conscientious couple has posted detailed reports of their 6-month
journey, complete with ratings of every activity, form of
accommodation, and restaurant.</li></ul>

<a href="http://tmn.com">Metanet,</a> the online conversation started a quarter-century ago by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meta_Network">Frank Burns</a> and nurtured forevermore by <a href="http://www.groupjazz.com/html/gj-the-crew.html">Lisa Kimball</a>, is celebrating with a party in Washington, DC, at the end of March. Lisa is such a prodigious networker that we profiled her in <a href="http://www.netage.com/pub/books/download_age.htm">The Age of the Network</a> (see &quot;<a href="www.netage.com/pub/books/AgeNet/CHAPTERS%20PDF/CHAPTER7.pdf">All the way to New York to buy a modem</a>,&quot; Chapter 7). Wish I could be there. Metanet was the second online community I joined (<a href="http://www.njit.edu/v2/CCCC/eies/eiesinfo.html">EIES</a> was first). Over the years, many good ideas and, more importantly, deep friendships have grown from the connections it's spawned. All will miss Frank at this celebration, whose laugh I can hear just typing this. Congratulations, Lisa, and warm fuzzies to all my friends from Spirit, the women's conference there.</p>
<p>With Lisa's permission, I'm posting the anniversary party details here as I know at least some friends from those days are reading:</p><blockquote><p>MetaNetwork is 25 years old this spring and we're having a party!&nbsp; You and all your family are invited ! </p>
<p>It will be held in the afternoon of March 29th - probably around 2pm ...at the home of:</p>
<p>Lois Mandelberg<br />6303 Waterway Place<br />Falls Church, Virginia&nbsp; 22044</p>
<p>mamalois[at]hotmail[dot]com</p>
<p>703-658-7776 (h)</p>
<p>Plans for pot luck are being organized in the MetaNet25 conference on Metanet ..</p>
<p>Hope we'll see you there!&nbsp; * lisa</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/11/caldwell.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="Caldwell" title="Caldwell" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/caldwell.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
Remember <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/02/let-soldiers-bl.html">Frontier 6</a>, the blogger who said that soldiers should be allowed to blog and post to YouTube? Well, now he's made his first appearance on Comedy Central. Last night, Lt. Gen. Bill Caldwell, recently the face of the military to the press in Iraq and now head of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, was the guest on The Daily Show. Caldwell was there to talk about <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2008/02/you-read-it-her.html">the new field manual for the Army</a>, which I mentioned here and in a piece for The Standard called &quot;<a href="http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/02/11/social-general">The social general</a>.&quot; Jon Stewart was his inimitable self, kidding Caldwell about the dry prose and the very thought that a soldier would pick up the field manual in the heat of battle. Caldwell held his own, explaining that its purpose was for training, not the quick look-up while in combat, and that it contains a different view of the soldier's role than has been prescribed before. Caldwell's best moment in the interview came when he talked about the true multi-tasking that soldiers have to do now - building a road one moment, taking sniper fire the next.&nbsp; His appearance on The Daily Show is part of the Army's campaign to market the new manual and its revolutionary contents, which say that diplomacy and nation-building must be held up as equal to &quot;offensive and defensive operations.&quot; <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=163654&amp;title=lt.-general-william-caldwell">You can see it for yourself.</a> </p>
