  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/.a/6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b-pi" style="display: inline"><img alt="Plane" class="at-xid-6a00df3523b1d088340105360cbbcb970b " src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mt_imported_image_1757842595.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left">So with no need for further explanation, you get the picture. Traveling earlier this week for a quick one-day with a lovely client, two workshops back-to-back. Flight, despite its customary lack of room, very pleasant, including the incredible good luck of sitting next to a Microsoft exec who, after hearing my woes with Word, hands me a &quot;magic card&quot; (his words) marked &quot;Quick Assistance,&quot; which allowed me to call a Microsoft support line, be greeted by &quot;Kathy,&quot; who with some instructions, enabled me to trash a few troublesome files and presto! I can drag-and-drop text again. Thanks, Steve Resnick!<br /><br />OK, we land. Progress to the shuttle bus at this airport, which is approximately the size of Massachusetts, arrive at car rental. No hybrids, no Garmins. Off I go in a car that doesn&#039;t use a key. A terrible light goes on. One I&#039;ve never seen before. I pull over, search the glove compartment in hopes of looking up the light problem, but there&#039;s only a CD in it. A CD. I return to rental place. Attendant gives me the &quot;boy, are you stupid, lady&quot; routine, says it&#039;s, of course, as everyone knows, the tire pressure light, then says he&#039;ll feel the tires for me (no comment) and that I should just ignore it because the tires are just fine. Now it&#039;s getting dark and I&#039;m watching the time and I&#039;m about to be late for the dinner so I take off. (He was right, I am stupid.)<br /><br />This is a city, if you can call a metropolis the size of, say, Dallas-Fort Worth a city, with no lights on their road signs. Or signs with the number of miles to the next destination. And no match between the printed maps and the number of miles apparently ahead.<br /><br />This post is getting too long. A purported 45-minute journey takes two hours. The exit numbers don&#039;t match the printed exit numbers - as in I am supposed to get off at 465E but the numbers are like, Exit 81 and 82. I end up on a one-way street with no exit other than the Chuck-E Cheese (is that how you even spell it?) parking lot. My room key (key, ha!) at the hotel doesn&#039;t work. My breakfast doesn&#039;t come via room service (&quot;there was a problem with your order so we didn&#039;t know what to do&quot; - uh, er, call me?). I can&#039;t get the trunk of the car open (remember, only a CD in the glove compartment).<br /><br />Skip to the event, which is great. Very nice people, good thinkers, and a wonderful time is had by all.<br /><br />Then I&#039;m leaving and ask the locals for directions back to the airport. &quot;Take 35 East. No, take 35 West. I don&#039;t know. You can take 35 East or West.&quot; Finally, it&#039;s decided I should take 35 West. I do. No problem other than it&#039;s growing dark again and I can&#039;t see the road signs and there are no signs to the airport until 1.5 miles before I get there. Arrive in about an hour&#039;s time at airport. Pull into car rental and am asked about car. The light is still on so I explain what happened. &quot;Well, *that&#039;s* not the tire light,&quot; says the attendant. &quot;Who told you that? You never should have been put in this car.&quot; Result = $40 credit.<br /><br />Then I get on the shuttle bus back to the terminal.<br /><br />Wrong bus. Turns out there are three American terminals. Silly me.<br /><br />Skytrain to proper terminal.<br /><br />Grab a sandwich.<br /><br />Get on plane.<br /><br />Have whole row to myself.<br /><br />Ah, the enchanting life of the consultant.<br /></div></div>

The photos begin with this one taken June 17,
2005, showing Dr G leaving the Neshoba County Court House in Philadelphia, Miss., with David. She was there to testify in the murder trial of Ku Klux Klansman Edgar Ray
Killen, accused in the 1964 killings of her
son, Andy, and two other civil rights workers (Michael Schwerner and James Chaney). Then read <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070818/NEWS/708180350/1001/news">this obit</a> by Jerry Mitchell, who kept this story alive for a very long time. Read more <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/SPECIAL17/60416008">here</a> about Mitchell's tireless investigative reporting that &quot;<span class="art_p_body">has unearthed documents, cajoled suspects and
witnesses, and quietly pursued evidence in the nation's notorious
killings from the civil rights era.&quot;</span></p>
<p>At the trial, Dr. G read <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">the postcard</a> that Andy mailed from Mississippi on the day he was killed.</p>
<p>Killen was convicted of &quot;<span class="art_p_body">orchestrating the killings,&quot; Mitchell writes, </span><span class="art_p_body">on the 41st anniversary of the young men's murders June 21, 1964, </span><span class="art_p_body">and is serving sixty years in prison for manslaughter.<br /><br />Mitchell's personal understanding of Dr G comes through in his piece, reflected in the quote he chose from her son:</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="art_p_body">Goodman’s son, David, said today: “Besides
being my mother, my mentor and spiritual guide, she taught me the
precious value of human dignity and the importance of speaking up and
acting whenever your own, your family’s or other people’s dignities and
civil rights are denied.”</span></p></blockquote><p>Other obits: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/17/AR2007081702093.html">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6858818,00.html">The Guardian</a>...just google.</p>

  <title>Bourne Betrayal rises to #9 on NY Times list!</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keen readers know of my recent meeting with <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/come-with-me-me.html">Eric Lustbader</a>, who is hands-down the biggest poster to this blog (grazie). Glory, glory. NY Times Book Review, tomorrow, July 15, 2007 does a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/review/15tbr.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">nice call out</a> to his <em>Bourne Betrayal </em>and gives Eric the space to explain how he's writing books about Robert Ludlum's characters. Interesting writing proposition, Eric, and what a great gift from Mr. Ludlum's family. Open to answering a coupla questions here? Now, I've put you on the spot.</p>
<p>Antiochian alert: Eric went to grammar school with Neelon (nee Pepper) Crawford, '69, married to Susan Hill, '70.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><span class="bold">THE BOURNE RESURGENCY:</span> Robert Ludlum died in
2001, but his books keep coming. The new one, “Robert Ludlum’s The
Bourne Betrayal,” written by Eric Van Lustbader, rises this week to No.
9 on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/books/bestseller/0715besthardfiction.html">fiction list</a>.
Van Lustbader, who also publishes thrillers under his own (excellent)
name, took over the Bourne franchise a few years ago. On his <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/index.asp">Web site</a>,
he notes that some people “still seem confused by my writing novels
about a character created by Robert Ludlum.” For anyone who is still
puzzled, here’s Van Lustbader’s stab at <a target="new" href="http://www.ericvanlustbader.com/thriller/content/news.asp">clearing everything up</a>:
“I was asked by the estate of the late Robert Ludlum to continue the
series Bob started. He wrote three Bourne novels (‘The Bourne
Identity,’ ‘The Bourne Supremacy,’ ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’). ... I have
so far written ‘The Bourne Legacy’ and ‘The Bourne Betrayal.’ These
books are written entirely by me from my own ideas, though some people
persist in thinking that I wrote them with Bob. This would be rather
difficult to do, since he’s dead. Also, he left no notes or unfinished
manuscripts pertaining to Jason Bourne. Are we clear now? Good!”</p></blockquote>

    <wp:comment_content>Aiming for the reasonable, Eric, as the intelligent may be beyond my ken but here goes:
Q?
A: [as in ask yourself the first question - dirty pool :)]
Q: In Agatha Christie's obit (don't remember where), she was quoted as saying she really wanted to be a concert pianist, not a mystery writer. You?
Q: You said you don't hang with writers cuz they're too similar to you. Who then? What varities?
Q: How are you working OrgScope into your new novel? A character with an OrgScope in her pocket?</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>I always wanted to be in a rock'n'roll band.  I spent 10 years in rock doing many other things (writing, producing, A&amp;amp;R, publicity, merchandising).  I was even on stage with a couple of bands I went on the road with (Elton John, Mountain -- but that's another story)-- but that's as far as I got.
Anyway, strange to say, it's too public a life for me. My getting up in front of people constantly wpould surely lead to a mental breakdown!
Tomorrow, next question answered. Tune in. (This is the Charles Dickins version of a Blog).</wp:comment_content>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of us living in the Greater Boston Globe area learned yesterday that the most familiar of sounds, the morning paper tossed into the driveway (or dropped on the front step or brushing our apartment doors) may soon be permanently silenced.</p><p>Yesterday&#039;s banner headline so stunned me that I couldn&#039;t even compose a post: &quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/04/times_co_threatens_to_shut_globe_seeks_20m_in_cuts_from_unions/">Times Co. threatens to shut Globe; seeks $20m in cuts from unions</a>.&quot; Later that day, The Times columnist <a href="http://twitter.com/nytimeskristof">Nicholas Kristof</a> posted this update to Twitter: &quot;<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Who would have ever, ever imagined that the Boston Globe might not survive? It&#039;s a grim time for a journalist.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, very grim. When the NY Times Company bought the Boston Globe back in 1993, some forward thinkers feared what was then perceived as the worst: that The Times management would turn the Globe into a regional paper.<br /><br />And indeed not many years passed before that proved mostly true (though there remains, almost against all odds, some fantastic &quot;Global&quot; reporting going on). Foreign bureaus were closed and the non-New England news seemed to increasingly bear the label of a news service, often The New York Times News Service.<br /><br />Another yes: all print media are suffering <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/you-wont-miss-it-til-its-gone-rocky-mountain-news.html">yadda</a> <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/03/speaking-of-newspapers-c-1989.html">yadda</a>. But as <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/02/cancel-your-newspaper-subscription-april-2043-no-sooner.html">others</a> are <a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/2009/04/reach-out-and-open-up-globe.html">saying</a>, a newspaper is not just a business. It&#039;s a way to keep a society honest through investigative reporting, informed through plain old good journalism, and together through speaking with an unmistakable voice.<br /><br />There are ways to solve this, New York Times Company, that fall outside the traditional means, axing everything in sight or demolishing the whole thing. We&#039;ve already lost many of our best Boston reporters.<br /><br />Thinking caps on, please. Fast. Yesterday&#039;s story gives the unions 30 days to make concessions. Make that 29 days. The response to yesterday&#039;s news is reflected in <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/05/threat_to_globe_triggers_flood_of_feelings/">an article today</a> and in the hundreds of comments on the Globe site itself.</span></span></p><p>A lot more than a newspaper is at stake.<br /><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"></span></span></p><p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"><br /></span></span></p>

    <wp:comment_content>JBobb, I agree. 26 years is a long time to be in the news biz.
And, Jay, I agree that bailing out the newspaper industry might be a lot more worthy than banks and cars. Why hasn't anyone thought of that? Disposable, like the paper they're printed on???</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Are nonprofits less efficient?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend is having problems being paid for services rendered to a nonprofit. Conclusion? Don&#039;t work for nonprofits, right?</p><p>In my experience, ta-da: wrong.</p><p>Having submitted invoices to many entities over the years -- everything from mega-corporations to city governments to tiny nonprofits -- the record holder for difficulty in being paid belongs to the big companies.</p><p>Back in the late 1980s, when Digital Equipment Corporation was the major employer in the cosmos (exaggeration, merely the universe), we were having problems being paid. So I decided to do a flow chart of the process. It took 19 separate signoffs. Other consultants started calling me for advice on how to be paid by DEC.</p><p>I guess that explains why Digital went out of business. Howevuh...while some companies are very efficient, I&#039;ve found it equally difficult with other big firms. The invoice submission process is a fine art (or really bad art) with ridiculous quirks that make slow nonprofits look like comets in comparison. The most ridiculous? Having to send paper copies of invoices -- you know, that stuff over in the pile in your paperless office -- to global enterprises. And then being told the paper copy, sent by overnight delivery service, was never received because Accounts Payable &quot;never heard of&quot; the person who signed for it in their Receiving Dept.</p><p>Meanwhile, I hope my friend is paid soon.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to <a href="http://melindamoses.wordpress.com/about/">Melinda Meyer Moses</a>, I was able to attend the <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/index.php">MIT Sloan CIO Symposium</a> yesterday. Although I wasn&#039;t able to sit in for the whole day, I was able to catch a few excellent sessions, including the one on <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/agenda.php">virtual organizations</a> (you&#039;ll have to scroll to find it on the agenda) where <a href="http://www.mitcio.com/speakers.php#">Simon Crosby</a>, Citrix&#039;s CTO for Virtualization and Management, dropped quite a few gems.</p><p>Honestly, it&#039;s hard for anyone on a panel about virtual organizations to say anything new. Most people are operating from the limited base of their own experience - their company, for example, which was the case with most panelists. I should say &quot;is&quot; the case with most panelists. I&#039;ve been on a slew of such panels.</p><p>And, as is typical, regardless of the question, especially at a tech conference, which is where, say, 99.99% of these panels take place, the answer is almost always about technology, i.e. we use x, y, and z. Further, the only technologies referenced (again, typically) are the real-time things - teleconferencing, screen sharing, video - all useful, necessary, yadda yadda, but, in my experience, not what makes for profound breakthroughs in how we can work differently in a no-travel, post-meltdown, carbon-emission-intensive, whatever-the-name-of-the-next-flu-is world.</p><p>Yesterday&#039;s panel, with its earnest participants, was no exception, which is why Simon&#039;s remarks stood out. Good work, Simon.

It seems that STILL the more things change, the more they stay the same, eh? Whether it's a vendor delivering to a client, or a CIO/CTO delivering to their (internal) clients ...
Make it simple, make it safer, start small, get the right people together before you start, get a sponsor (although these days those sponsors might be in the head office or in the offices next to you), expect (and work through) the hiccups ...
So at the end of the day people can actually begin to work together, collaborating, innovating, focusing on the important things more and tending to the systems a bit less.
Focus on the teams first ...</wp:comment_content>

  <title>Advice to Hillary; thankfully never sent #imwithher</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have six things in common with Hillary. Both our husbands studied at Oxford where each lived at 46 Leckford Road, a house mine originally rented (and moved out of when hers moved in). We’re both 69 (I’m a few months older). We both loved the teen idol Fabian (I met him in person and he kissed me on the cheek). We both spoke at our college graduations (she was filmed; there’s merely a still photo of me). We both have worked all our adult lives. And we both are grandmothers.</p>
<p>When she was still thinking about running (or at least that was the public position), her first grandchild, Charlotte, was born. I felt impelled to give advice about her impending political decision, which in a moment for me of “the world [being] too much with us,” was simply this: Don’t. My argument against her running for president was based on my (and many others’) opinion and experience as to where the deepest satisfactions in life originate—in accomplishments or in love. They shouldn’t be such binary choices but for women they are.</p>
<p>I never sent the advice or published the piece; she ran; and now we’re in the range of double-digit hours until we know whether indeed she will be the next/first-woman/first-former-First-Lady President of this continuous experiment in democracy called the United States of America.</p>
<p>For her sake, I wish she hadn’t run. Far and away the most abusive campaign in our history; far and away the most shocking, so appalling&#160;in its turns that we writers find ourselves saying that a novel following the plot of this election would never find a publisher due to its unbelievability; and far and away the most dangerous for what it could mean if she does not win (not to mention mounting fears if she does, c.f., the threats of armed insurrection).</p>
<p>For her sake, I wish I’d sent this advice and that she’d followed it, which my fourth-generation feminist daughters were shocked to see coming from this granddaughter of a suffragist (she marched until 1920), born to a feminist mother (who didn&#039;t change her name when first married and always worked outside the home), I, who was lucky enough to turn 21 in 1968 at the height of the second-wave of feminism, which I embraced.</p>
<p>But for our sake, I’m very glad she ran. Her example is straightening the spines of little girls, young women, and even women my age; her grit is as incomparable as any of our peers, male or female; her ability to think of her feet is as good as anyone’s; and her skill at throwing off the insults, dismissals, and now the very threats to her life is, how do I say this, incredible.</p>
<p>Having followed&#160;her more closely these past two years, I’m betting that she’s found a way to take those calls from Chelsea anyway (see below).</p>
<p><strong>And I’m sure she’s going to win.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote--but never sent--on September 24, 2014:</p>
<p><em>Rock, Grandma, Don’t Run</em></p>
<p>In the constellation of unwelcome advice, none is less desirable than re: family. Young mothers are the unwitting recipients of bounteous bromides as per the passerby, who, touching your baby, which, first of all, why are you touching my baby, catalogues a registry of rebukes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t you think you should have a hat on her?</li>
<li>Why are you feeding him avocado?</li>
<li>Shouldn’t she be in bed by now?</li>
<li>What? She’s in your bed?</li>
<li>You changed him where? On the hood of your car?</li>
<li>Your three-year-old still has a bottle?</li>
<li>Your four-year-old boy wears pink?</li>
<li>Your five-year-old girl refuses to wear pink?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s endless and annoying and so, with this in mind, I offer the following unsolicited advice to a friend of a friend, a woman I have never met, one so famous that she’s in the single-name league of Madonna and Beyoncé, the rock star of politics and world’s most famous new grandmother, Hillary.</p>
<p>“I’m baaaack,” you sang to the steak-fry crowd in Iowa. ReadyforHillary—not to mention 656 pages of <em>Hard Choices</em>—seems to answer the question of whether you’re running. But all of that was pre-Charlotte.</p>
<p>Today you are now like me (sorta kinda: mine had preemie twins; no one can spell my last name while yours is all but a verb), Hillary, grandmother to the child of your daughter, who is setting off into the rainforest of parenting—unexpected showers, strange storms of illness, odd creatures (which is how first-time parents often feel about their quirky newborns)—with abundant resources but no experience, because you are not a mom or dad until you really are one.</p>
<p>Until you’ve done it a hundred times, you don’t really know how to change a diaper without really waking up, or how to swaddle a baby, or whether to call the doctor for the millionth time because this one might really be the really real thing and what if you don’t, who knows, your baby might be really dead before they call back?</p>
<p>Your daughter will be a natural, of course, because that’s what we all say—and feel— about our daughters because in the end it is a very natural human thing to give birth—i.e. how could 100 billion have made it out of the womb in the past 50,000 years unless it were relatively ordinary? But the data is incontrovertible: until you’ve done it, you don’t know jack—or Charlotte.</p>
<p>Which is why your daughter will be calling you every twenty minutes or so for the next several years, asking you questions that begin, “Did I…” at which point you will spiral down into The Abyss of Guilt Just Over the Cliff of Forgotten Memories. I’m sure you, unlike me, kept a daily baby book recording every one of your daughter’s projectile vomits and major accomplishments: first time sleeping more than two consecutive hours, first time unclenching her fists, first time rolling over. And you, being a strong global figure and role model extraordinaire, won’t be hurt when she yells at you for not remembering.</p>
<p>Even with a staff to help her because what new mother doesn’t need an overnight baby nurse, a daytime nanny, a cook, a housekeeper, and a personal secretary (if only! if only!), she will still need one particular person who can’t be hired: you.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the point of this unsolicited advice: You need not to miss this. You need not to miss the tiny advances, the first time Baby Charlotte does this, that, and the other thing, the first time your back aches from holding her because nothing hurts so good.</p>
<p>Yes, you can be president of the most powerful country the world has ever known. Yes, you can sit at the big desk and put Putin in his place. Yes, you can out-Kissinger Kissinger but you won’t be there for those first kisses. Might it be a tad awkward as president to take Baby Charlotte’s first phone call, which is not that long from now because just as you can’t comprehend that your baby has just had a baby, you will not believe how quickly the little twitchling goes from blob to blogger, if you’re in the Situation Room watching ISIS cowards being taken out?</p>
<p>Trust me: I want a woman in The White House. And I want you to have the same freedom to make the choice to run that your husband had. You do. And if that’s what you choose, you’ll probably win but what you’ll lose may well&#160;be&#160;far more profound.</p>
<p>Rock that baby, Hillary. Don’t run. It will make you all much happier.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks, again, to Matt Richtel for the excellent reporting on the dangers of driving while talking. Yesterday, the second-in-two-days Page One headline in The New York Times: &quot;<a href="http://www.mydeo.com/videorequest.asp?XID=11977&amp;CID=171174">Driven to Distraction: US Withheld Data on Risks of Distracted Driving</a>.&quot;</p><p>I don&#039;t need to go into more detail than this: The US government has had the data proving that it&#039;s extremely dangerous--akin to being drunk--to yabber on the phone while driving since 2003. Hands free or not. Makes no difference.</p><p>Richtel has done a superb job of following the timeline, putting together the salient facts, and pointing fingers in the right direction.</p><p>We all have stories to tell about the risks; I&#039;ve been <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/cell-phones/">posting mine</a> as regular readers know. And I&#039;ve come to the sorry conclusion that the person who <a href="http://endlessknots.netage.com/endlessknots/2009/07/look-both-ways-before.html">sideswiped me</a> in Brooklyn last week was likely on the phone.</p><p>Here are a few blood-boiling paragraphs from Richtel&#039;s fury-maker:</p><blockquote><p>The former head of the highway safety agency said he was urged to
withhold the research to avoid antagonizing members of Congress who had
warned the agency to stick to its mission of gathering safety data but
not to lobby states.</p><p>Critics say that rationale and the failure
of the Transportation Department, which oversees the highway agency, to
more vigorously pursue distracted driving has cost lives and allowed to
blossom a culture of behind-the-wheel multitasking.</p><p>“We’re
looking at a problem that could be as bad as drunk driving, and the
government has covered it up,” said Clarence Ditlow, director of the
Center for Auto Safety. </p></blockquote><p>It took filing under the Freedom of Information Act, by the way, to force the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to release the report.</p><p>Now I&#039;m asking readers to leave a comment if you&#039;ve given up the deadly habit.</p>

  <title>Harvest Soup inspired by Daniel Bruce</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And now, by popular request, this recipe.</p>
<p>First came in contact with the basis for this soup when daughter Miranda (<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/TurkeynoseGoesGlobal/recipes/recipes.html">her fine recipes</a>) took a semester away from college to earn her <a href="http://www.bu.edu/foodandwine/culinary/">certificate in culinary arts at Boston University</a>, highly recommended 14-week program. Each week, the public was invited to lectures with famous chefs (yes, I sat a few feet from Jacques Pepin, among others) as they cooked. A few times we were invited to actually cook with them. My big catch? <a href="http://www.bostonchefs.com/clients/Meritage/chef_page/">Daniel Bruce</a>, chef extraordinaire at the Boston Harbor Hotel, leading to my first and last time cooking fois gras.&nbsp; Bruce is the generator of the original recipe for the soup below that I’ve altered a bit. Thanks, Daniel, for the now heavily-stained printout of your menu/recipe list, “Autumn in New England: A Festive Dinner with Daniel Bruce, Wednesday, October 15, 1997.”</p>
<p>Harvest Soup (serves 12)</p>
<p>Basic Soup:<br />4 oz butter<br />1 large sweet onion (Spanish, vidalia)<br />3-1/4 c carrots (4 or 5, depending on size)<br />3-1/4 c rutabaga (large-it’s in the turnip family)<br />3-1/4 c butternut squash (buy cut up if possible)<br />4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />8 c chicken or vegetable stock (I use veg)<br />4 cloves smashed garlic<br />4 leaves fresh sage<br />healthy amount of peppercorns (10-12)<br />kosher (large grain) salt to your liking</p>
<p>Garnish:<br />1 c cheddar cheese (grated)<br />1/3 c toasted walnuts (or butternuts if you can find them)<br />1/4 c fresh thyme (remove leaves from stems)<br />3/4 c rutabaga (dice and steam)<br />3/4 c butternut squash (dice and steam)</p>
<p>1. Cut all veggies for soup into 2 inch chunks.</p>
<p>2. Melt butter in large skillet or soup pan. Add onions, garlic, rutabaga, and carrots and cook over medium heat until onions glisten (about 10 mins). Add squash, stock, thyme and sage (herbs tied for easy removal). Simmer until veggies are soft (20-30 mins, depending on size of your chunks).</p>
<p>3. Remove herbs. Puree in blender until smooth as silk. Return to heat. Stir in half-and-half and season to taste.</p>
<p>4. Put garnish in soup bowl and ladle soup over (or vice-versa). Can add chopped chives.</p>
<p><em>Can make this ahead and freeze. Also feel free to add parsnips, my fave soup veg, for extra sweetness.</em></p>

    <wp:comment_content>I'm looking forward to watching the panel unfold via Twitter - would be cool if y'all could add to the online conversation while there.
Too much to ask?

    <wp:comment_content>Thankyou,
I've been so lucky to attend your session. And your work like a moderator is great.
Your panel gave me some good idea in how to increase my "corporate" blogging levels.
I learned lot.</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Jessica - saw you wander past today while I was talking to someone on the  tradeshow floor, meant to stop and say hello (again), but I lost you in the crowd!
How was the audience for your discussion?</wp:comment_content>

    <wp:comment_content>Janet, did we Twitter enough? I asked the panel and the audience to fulfill your request. Hope it worked.
MMondora, thanks so much for your nice comments. Let us know what happens with your blogging.
Dan, room was packed and lots of participation. Very very fun.</wp:comment_content>
