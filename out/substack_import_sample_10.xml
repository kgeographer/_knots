</p>
<p>A few hours ago, I received this email from my friend of forty years, David Goodman:</p><blockquote><p><em>My mother left this stage at 1:18 AM this morning and is now with my father and brother Andrew and others on the next level. I am sure she is having a fine time.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/us/18goodman.html?ref=obituaries"><strong>Complete obit in New York Times</strong></a>, Aug 18, 2007 </p>
<p>Readers of this blog may remember <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/remembering-and.html">my post</a> of June 21, where I included, with his permission, the extraordinary postcard that David gave me in May when I had dinner with Carolyn Drucker Goodman (his mother) at her apartment on New York's Upper West Side. At nearly 92, she remained extraordinarily dignified, surrounded by the memorabilia of an historic life and the good taste of a sophisticated intellectual who'd lived in the city and known fascinating people.<br /> </p>
<p>Carolyn Goodman, as in the mother of Andrew Goodman, as in Goodman-Schwerner-and-Chaney, the three young civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi in 1964, here with the other two mothers at Andy's funeral.<a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/18/funeral.jpg"><img width="100" height="126" border="0" alt="Funeral" title="Funeral" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/funeral.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
</p>
<p>David's light touch in reporting his mother's death is emblematic of her spirit. She carried herself with rare dignity and grace along avenues where others would have been crawling on the pavement begging. I don't know how anyone survives their child's death, no less brutal murder by the Ku Klux Klan, but she did, while maintaining a complex and influential career as a psychologist (assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein Medical School among other honors-see the jump page for her entire resume and list of publications) and maintaining a lifelong dedication to the <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/andrewgoodmanfdn/">Andrew Goodman Foundation</a> that she and her husband started in 1966.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/196609_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="100" height="129" border="0" alt="196609_cg_photo" title="196609_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/196609_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" /></a>
From the moment I met Carolyn in 1969, I wanted to be like her. It was just months after her husband had died suddenly of a stroke, barely five years after her son's murder. (&quot;Andy's death killed him,&quot; David once told me.) She was 54 and, at 22, I was overcome with admiration at the composure of this absolutely gorgeous woman, who'd lost her child and husband in such rapid sequence. I was struck also with her beautiful skin (milk baths were the secret, David said).</p>
<p>Many times since, when I've felt overwhelmed by the cards on my table, I've thought of Carolyn, her just continuing, never wallowing, just continuing, positively, without complaint or fury, just continuing.<br /><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/17/1998_cg_photo.jpg"><img width="100" height="129" border="0" alt="1998_cg_photo" title="1998_cg_photo" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/1998_cg_photo.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a><br />In 2002, I was honored to present her with the Champions of Freedom Award from <a href="http://freedomhouse.com">Freedom House</a>, here in Boston. She was nearly 88 at the time, still very beautiful, warm, and articulate about the choices she'd made in her life.
</p>
<p>So tonight I've lit a very special candle, given to me by Sylvia, my Antioch college roommate, about the time we both met David. Today is Sylvia's 60th birthday and she too was with me for our last dinner with Carolyn on May 18, 2007.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; New York, NY</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; LIFE’S WORK AND CURRICULUM VITAE</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has been working for causes of social justice for most of her life.&nbsp; During her undergraduate years at Cornell University, she and her husband-to-be were involved in organizing Farmer Cooperatives.&nbsp; In the late 1930s she became Women’s Division Chair of the Join Antifascist Refugee Committee that supported Spanish Republicans who fled or were exiled by Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the early years of her marriage to Robert Goodman, a graduate of the Cornell School of Engineering, Carolyn Goodman began her graduate work in psychology.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman became Assistant Clinical Professor, Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Unit Chief of PACE Family Treatment Center a program of the Bronx Psychiatric Center.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Goodman designed the Parent Adult Child Education Program (PACE), in 1968 for emotionally disturbed mothers with high risk preschool children.&nbsp; PACE has been replicated in this country and abroad and in September, 1980 was presented with a GOLD Award for program excellence by the Board of Hospital and Community Psychiatry of the American Psychiatric Association.&nbsp; PACE was also the recipient of the Ruth Kirzon Group Humanitarian Award for Services to Handicapped Children.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Goodman administered the PACE program, provided direct clinical services to parents, children and teachers.&nbsp; She developed curriculum for PACE staff education and medical students, conducted seminars for local and national mental health agencies and supervised Fellows, residents, other clinicians and undergraduate students in the mental health field.&nbsp; Dr. Goodman has written and published a number of articles on the treatment and psycho-education of high risk families.&nbsp; See Attachment A for a detailed list of her Professional Training, Academic Honors, Professional Experience, Selected Publications and Presentations, and Awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman had three sons; Jonathan, Andrew and David born in 1941, 1943 and 1946, respectively.&nbsp; Andrew Goodman, the second of her sons, was murdered for his unflagging belief in equal justice for all.&nbsp; He was a volunteer in the Mississippi 1964 Summer Project, an important step in the Civil Rights Movement involving thousands of students, teachers, lawyers, doctors, and clergymen.&nbsp; Shortly after arriving in Mississippi, on June 21, 1964, he, along with James Chaney and Michael Schwerner, were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in Philadelphia, Mississippi.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deaths of these three young activists was a tragedy that illuminated the evils of a segregated community that shook the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn and Robert Goodman founded the Andrew Goodman Foundation in 1966 to help carry on the goals and dreams of Andrew Goodman.&nbsp; Sadly, Robert Goodman died suddenly in 1969.&nbsp; In 1989, 25 years after the death of her son Andrew, Carolyn Goodman called together the Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner families to form a coalition that would commemorate and perpetuate the legacy not only of the three young men but of the thousands of people, black and white, who had risked and lost their lives in the struggle for civil and human rights.&nbsp; The credibility of the Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner Coalition captured the interest of young people and attracted the attention of the national media.&nbsp; A Freedom Caravan traveled from Philadelphia, Mississippi to New York City, where thousands of people heard speakers such as former Governor Mario Cuomo, artists such as Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Peter Paul and Mary, and Jessye Norman celebrate youth action.&nbsp; These artists and speakers reminded the crowd of the need to carry the torch lit by their counterparts 25 years earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the summer of 1994, Carolyn Goodman under the auspices of the Andrew Goodman Foundation sponsored an unprecedented project called Freedom Summer ’94.&nbsp; Through this project, the Andrew Goodman Foundation provided training and technical assistance to youth organizers from all over the country.&nbsp; YouthAction, one of these groups, a national youth organization, formerly part of the Executive Committee of Freedom Summer ’94, continues to train grassroots organizers who are growing in numbers and effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Inspired by the work being done by young people, and frustrated that social action by today’s youth is ignored, Carolyn Goodman and the Andrew Goodman Foundation initiated its latest project, a documentary about youth activism in the 1990s entitled HIDDEN HEROES.&nbsp; This film tells the story of today’s young activists, people who are working to improve the quality of life in their communities.&nbsp; Despite the media’s portrayal of today‘s young people as apathetic and violent, there are young organizers addressing issues of local concern, such as education, ecology, voter registration, anti-drug intervention, and racial tension.&nbsp; HIDDEN HEROES has been distributed to schools, libraries and other educational outlets to inform young people about essential work being done by their peers.&nbsp; The film is accompanied by a curriculum guide, prepared by students under the auspices of the Community Relations Department of Shoreham – Wading River High School of New York, and was developed by a highly experienced educator.&nbsp; &nbsp;It has helped teachers lead discussions that promote a different perspective from that of negative media messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Carolyn Goodman has spoken at schools, colleges, churches, synagogues, museums, the United Nations and before various local, state and federal governmental bodies on all subjects relating to social activism for human dignity and civil rights.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For reasons as yet unrevealed (and certainly not because I subscribe to the fine <a href="http://www.interweaveknits.com/">Interweave Knits</a>), about six months ago, <a href="http://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a> showed up in my mail. And I don't mean my inbox. We have an old-fashioned mail slot cut into the wall by the front door of our old house. For the past six months or so, WIRED has been among the daily deluge of catalogs. When the August issue arrived, I got excited. &quot;How To: ... &quot; followed by a long list that included &quot;Rule the Blogosphere&quot; and &quot;Email like a Pro&quot; got me turning pages.</p>
<p>Well, I'm still looking for tips on how to rule the blogosphere. Great cover teaser, no article by that name. But -- and especially if -- you're a cube captain with action figures decorating your work space, there's lots here for you (e.g., never place Wonder Woman and Superman in, you know, suggestive positions).</p>
<p>There's a great 100-word (if that) squib on what to do if you're the only person dialing into a conference call: &quot;Announce yourself when it begins and remind people that you cannot see air quotes or scribbles on the whiteboard. Have an intern email you digital snaps. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. And mute your phone when you're not speaking, so no one hears SportsCenter in the background.&quot; OR, perhaps, ask your co-workers to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webinar">web conferencing</a>?</p>
<p>&quot;Email like a Pro&quot; is terrific if you're, how shall I say this, engaged in shady activities? The six pointers are aimed at keeping you out of court, or jail, I can't tell. The actual title of this one, &quot;Lawyer-Proof Your Email,&quot; requires no further clarification.</p>
<p>There is a good little list on how to use a wiki. Other than that, the tips on how to refill the watercooler and how to bully your coworkers into donating more leave me, well, wondering why WIRED has sought me out.</p>

<blockquote><p>With the births, time forgot the concept of moving forward. It went
horizontal. Where even a week earlier, the hours clicked me along from
my writing desk to the garden to the dinner table to the living room
for a meeting, now they sent me sideways, depositing me in the
after-birth where time advanced so peacefully that I could eavesdrop on
the long conversation between the cardinals nested in the juniper on
the northeast corner of the garage, follow the scrape of Tonin’s pencil
across his big white sheet of butcher paper in his studio up the spiral
stairs, vibrate to the tingle of chimes in the mountain laurel on the
patio below, all background music for the babies as they suckled,
working milk from my breasts, building muscle in their chins and cheeks
for all their jawboning to come.</p>
<p>
I constructed sentences whose words I’d always known but whose peculiar sequencing I’d never before considered.</p>
<p>
What lives lay in front of mine? How many generations would our family endure into the future?</p>
<p>
Who would populate our babies’ worlds? Who would become their jewels, their lifelong companions whose secrets they kept?</p>
<p>
What confusions of the heart, unintended slights, self-doubts, and
disappointments would chafe their routines, pull rugs from under their
precious feet?</p>
<p>
Were my babies’ cries despairs at the plight of human existence or were
they little thespians practicing for their dramas to come?</p>
<p>
How would they solve the riddles born with their souls?</p>
<p>
What foods would the people who grew in me crave? Would they love beets?</p>
<p>
Had they, my little daughter and my little son, had they enough to eat? Would they always?</p>
<p>
Would Tonin’s intuition and my logic short-circuit the genetic wires in their brains?</p>
<p>
Would Andy write? Would Zivvy build? Would she lead an organization; would he be a rock star?</p>
<p>
Or would they move to another planet entirely, another solar system, a
universe far beyond the second floor of this eighteenth-century house
where they were born? Where would I be then?</p>
<p>
Where was my edge limned and where did their selves begin?</p>
<p>
I explored their mental caves, twirling fragments of cognition gelling
in their small brains. I could see through their fleshy foreheads,
rippled with the tracks of the birth canal, into the arithmetic of
their minds, observing ideas dividing and multiplying, memories stored,
the two halves of Zivvy’s brain rushing toward each other at twice the
speed of Andy’s (my facts were never far away). I tried to perceive
from their insides, from their points of view, watching them opening
their eyes to acquire mental snapshots of their new world, and assuming
that, when they closed them, they assembled what they’d captured into
panoramas of their dawning worldviews.</p>
<p>
And who was I on this journey?</p>
<p>
I’d been piecing my own reality together for almost three decades, my
own world, and now my own included two more people I’d never expected,
twin shocks whose arrival toppled my balance and sped me into new
territory.</p>
<p>
They were Tonin’s babies before they were mine, he wanted them long
before I was entertaining thoughts of children, he needed them to be
who he wanted to be. Now I was the mother, not the child without one, I
was protector, provider, materfamilias, once and forever humanity’s
first face to these two of its progeny.</p>
<p>
These thinkings, these awes, these terrors unsettled and delighted me
as baby-time ticked by, every moment, the one after and the one before,
changing Zivvy’s diaper, wiping away Andy’s spit-up. I circled the
whole of Zivvy’s round back with my thumb, working the bubble of air up
her digestive track until she could expel it in a belch louder than she
was big, and then Andy cried out and my chemistry called back, rushing
oxytocin to unlatch the milk locks, trickling out through my nipple
even before he started sucking, on to his cheek as he turned his head
this way and that, searching for the spigot with its hindmilk, the
honey settling at the bottom.</p>
<p>
Twenty, thirty minutes, two hours passed this way, me trying to recall
how long we’d been lying there, which one I’d last changed. When had I
most recently eaten? Had I eaten? Me, no longer simply me.</p>
<p>
Andrew. My father’s name, his genetic material, his head in the palm of
my hand, my little boy’s body stretched out along my arm, his face
wrinkled and splotchy, and, though the same weight as Zivvy, six
pounds, one ounce (I did know how to carry them to term, as I would
prove again astonishingly soon after this), rounder, an integer
shorter, he, a foot and a half, she plus an inch.</p>
<p>
My son with the magnificent feet. I’d never been much of a photographer
but, as a gift to mark the pregnancy, Janos had put a 35-millimeter
Pentax in my hands. Over the course of the past months, I’d practiced,
taking pictures of Treasure pounding down her sourdough loaves and
gathering up her squash blossoms, of the granite Buddha Tonin had set
by the mountain laurel. In early February only Buddha’s crown peaked
above snow and we called him Snow Buddha; in April, he was Tulip Buddha
with pink ones at his feet. And of Tonin, many pictures, of Tonin
examining a bevel he’d just made in an edge, smoothing his palm across
a board he’d just sanded, standing at his drafting board jotting notes
on his big white sheets, cracking eggs into a bowl for our <em>omelettes
aux fines herbes</em>.</p>
<p>
I learned to set the light meter, adjust the shutter speed, snap, snap,
snap, thread the film across the sprockets, and wind the reel in an
instant. Now, I was focusing the 105-millimeter lens down on Andy’s
perfect feet, his long wrinkled toes crimped into the soles.</p>
<p>
Zivvy, born longer, was smooth. Where Andy’s feet captivated me,
Zivvy’s head did, delicate in its proportions, crown to forehead,
eyebrows to chin, nose to cheeks, precise. Her little symmetrical face.
Eyes even, equal, wide, intricately edged lips, pursed, small fist by
her cheek waiting to wave (or punch). She didn’t sleep the way Andy
did, not that she fussed; she came out of me with her eyes open and
stayed awake a good deal of the time. When she did sleep, she woke
quickly, alert, ready to go, my daughter. My daughter.</p>
<p>No longer just a
daughter, now the mother of one.</p>
<p>
Of two.</p></blockquote>

  <title>Boston top blog city</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glad to be contributing to the stats here in The Hub, where, apparently, there are <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/boston_bloggies.html">more bloggers</a> per block than anywhere else on earth, including Silly-con Valley, as per this post to the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/">Daily Business Update</a>. And happy to see our friend, <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/index.html">David Weinberger</a>, quoted, possibly the most quotable person I know:</p><blockquote><p> According to <a href="http://outside.in/Boston">OutsideIn.com</a>,
a website that tracks neighborhood blogging, Boston was the &quot;bloggiest
city&quot; in America for the two-month period of March and April.</p>
<p> Behind Boston were Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p> OutsideIn.com says it tracks blogging activity in about 60 urban
areas and nearly 3,500 neighborhoods, and it arrived at its rankings
through a &quot;blogging quotient&quot; that factors in a metropolitan area's
population with the number of blog posts about a specific location.</p>
<p> By that measure, Greater Boston had 89 posts per 100,000 residents,
edging out Greater Philadelphia, which had 88 posts, and Greater
Pittsburgh, which had 53 posts, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, perhaps, such well-wired metro areas as San Francisco
and Seattle were farther down the list, with roughly 40 posts per
100,000 residents, Outsidein.com said.</p>
<p> Why was Greater Boston number one? Outsidein.com chief executive
Steven Berlin Johnson offered this theory: Blogs thrive where locals
are wired, well-educated, and obsessed with politics, a topic that
inspires bloggers to unleash their prose. Another popular blog topic
locally: healthcare...</p>
<p> Blogs are such a new phenomenon that methods for tracking blog
activity are still in their early stages, said David Weinberger, a
fellow at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p> And in seeking to pinpoint blogging hotbeds, he added, raw numbers
may not tell the whole story; also relevant are the quality of the
content and whether blog posts help build a community.</p>
<p>Still, Weinberger said, &quot;I'm proud to live in the bloggiest city in the universe.&quot;</p></blockquote>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ellenmeister.com/">Ellen Meister</a> is a generous contributor to <a href="http://zoetrope.com">Zoetrope</a>, where I met her. <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/10/meistercover_2.jpeg"><img width="100" height="63" border="0" alt="Meistercover_2" title="Meistercover_2" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/meistercover_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;float: right" /></a>
Over the past few years, she's let other Zoetropers peer into her experience as a first-time author with a two-book deal.<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_oe_1_see_all/102-7551158-1680922?ie=UTF8&amp;relSet=0060824816">Secret Confessions of the Applewood PTA</a> </em>came out in hardcover in '06, as did the audio version narrated by Lisa Kudrow; paperback out now. Ellen's doing a virtual book tour, meaning interviews with her in lots of places.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FreePint's <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm">235th issue</a>, just out today, features <strong>My Favourite Tipples, </strong><a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#favourites">literally mine.</a> FreePint goes twice a month to roughly 100,000 &quot;information workers.&quot;</p>
<p>How does something like this come about, my list of favorite websites published in an online newsletter based in the UK? Hint to speakers: As people are coming into your next session, wander around, introduce yourself, ask people's names. Practicing my preaching, I did this at our <a href="http://enterprise2conf.com">Enterprise 2.0</a> workshop that Sandy Kemsley reported on in her post, <strong><a href="http://www.column2.com/2007/06/enterprise-20-reports-from-the-frontier/">Reports from the Frontier</a></strong><strong>.</strong> There I met <a href="http://www.freepint.com/issues/090807.htm#editorial">Monique Cuvelier</a>, editor of FreePint, who handed me her business card and suggested I might want to write something for the newsletter. After the conference, <a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/endlessknots/2007/06/conferring-on-t.html">I fulfilled my pledge</a> to write to everyone who'd handed me a business card. Monique responded by asking me for this little piece.</p>
<p>Why not <a href="http://www.freepint.com/author/">send Monique</a> your &quot;tipples?&quot; Read on for mine.</p><blockquote></blockquote>

<p>My Favourite Tipples

<p class="heading"><strong>By Jessica Lipnack</strong></p>
<p class="plain"><img width="90" height="60" border="0" align="right" title="Jessica Lipnack" alt="Jessica Lipnack" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/jessica_lipnack90x60.jpg" />In
my work on networks and virtual teams--and as a writer, I'm always
looking around for creative and thought-provoking ideas -- here's where
I go on a regular basis to shake up my thinking. </p>
<ul class="plain"><li>For original thinking about the far edges of where the Web can take
us, bookmark Minding the Planet, where Nova Spivack holds forth:
&lt;<a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Michael Sampson of Christchurch, NZ, a tireless blogger and expert
on all things collaboration, is also known for his ability to take
verbatim notes at conferences and post them immediately:
&lt;<a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/">http://www.michaelsampson.net/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Writers (aren't we all writers now?), come hither! Francis Ford
Coppola's immensely generous gift to the writing community offers
review exchanges and excellent discussion forums - all completely
free: &lt;<a href="http://www.zoetrope.com/">http://www.zoetrope.com/</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Running a Hospital, the blog of the CEO of a large American medical
centre, is informative about health care, as well as funny and
controversial, and even includes the occasional recipe:
&lt;<a href="http://runningahospital.blogspot.com/">http://runningahospital.blogspot.com</a>&gt;.<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Travelling on your mind? Don't set foot in Oceania or a good part of
Asia without Turkeynose.com &lt;<a href="http://www.turkeynose.com/">http://www.turkeynose.com</a>&gt;, where a
conscientious couple has posted detailed reports of their 6-month
journey, complete with ratings of every activity, form of
accommodation, and restaurant.</li></ul>

    <wp:comment_content>You won't, Lee. Your stuff is great. Is there a way to post the clips themselves to Typepad? I copied in the HTML like the directions say, but, alas, when I posted, it looked like, well, HTML.</wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://endlessknots.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/06/leelefeverwikisinplainenglish177.jpeg"><img alt="Leelefeverwikisinplainenglish177" border="0" height="74" src="http://kgnomad.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/leelefeverwikisinplainenglish177.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;float: left" title="Leelefeverwikisinplainenglish177" width="100" /></a>
Confused by all the new terms that get thrown around in meetings, in the paper, on TV, in emails? <a href="http://commoncraft.com">Common Craft</a>, a consulting company based in Seattle, Washington, has taken it upon itself to define terms in an amusing and easy-to-understand way. Its <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/video/social-bookmarking" target="_self">short online videos </a>-- &quot;Social Networking in Plain English,&quot; &quot;Wikis in Plan English,&quot; and &quot;RSS in Plain English&quot; -- are guaranteed to save you hours of anguish and embarrassment. Take a look and you&#039;ll thank me--and especially Common Craft--for this post.</p>
<p><em>Backstory-ish sort of thing: I found Common Craft because I subscribe (RSS feed) to <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/">KM Space</a>, which I discovered after its blogger, Doug Cornelius, wrote about <a href="http://kmspace.blogspot.com/2007/06/90-people-10-technology.html">one of our sessions</a> at Enterprise 2.0. Thanks, Doug.</em></p>

  <title>Going around IT to connect</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today's Boston Globe carries a short piece by business reporter Chris Reidy that is likely to cause some CIO arm hairs to stand at attention. <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a> confirms findings that we published with two business school professors in Harvard Business Review in May '04 (&quot;<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=R0405J">Can Absence Make a Team Grow Stronger</a>?&quot;).</p>
<p>In the study, designed by USC's Marshall School of Business Professor Ann Majchrzak and UNC'S Kenan-Flagler School of Business Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship Arvind Malhotra, we found that 50% of &quot;far-flung team&quot; members used Instant Messaging (IM) even when their companies prohibited it. The Yankee Group, whose research is reported today, says that only one-third of the companies they surveyed offer IM. But that doesn't deter employees who regularly find the best tools for their work, regardless of corporate IT policies.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: CIOs, Listen Up! Pay attention to the natural resources that your employees gravitate toward. Everyone wants work to be easier and so those with the energy will seek out those tools that serve them best.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>From Boston.com (under 500 words so OK to quote in its entirety):</p><blockquote><h2>Monday, August&nbsp; 6, 2007</h2>
<h3><a target="new" title="Employees bypassing IT departments" href="http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2007/08/employees_bypas.html">Employees bypassing IT departments</a></h3></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p> The widespread adoption of consumer technologies in the workplace,
such as outside instant messaging services, poses a potential threat to
corporate information-technology departments, according to a new report.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The report, titled &quot;Zen and the Art of Rogue Employee Management,&quot; is from the <a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/">Yankee Group</a>, a Boston-based market research group focused on global connectivity.</p>
<p> According to the report, nearly 50 percent of employees feel more
empowered than IT to control their personal IT environment, a
development that could lead to a potentially &quot;hazardous mix of secured
and unsecured applications in the enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p> Only about a third of companies offer instant-messaging, and when a
company doesn't, many employees will resort to using consumer IM
products from the likes of AOL or Yahoo to communicate sensitive
company information to colleagues and customers; these consumer
products lack the &quot;robust security&quot; measures that are a key feature of
workplace IM offerings, noted Joshua Holbrook, manager of the Yankee
Group Enterprise Research program. </p>
<p> To address this challenge, the Yankee Group suggests that corporate
IT departments adopt a &quot;Zen-like approach&quot; that doesn't seek to dictate
policy and enforce standards but rather looks to set guidelines and
steer employees in the right direction.</p>
<p>
